THERE is no record to show in what part of London
Holbein took up his residence upon his return to England.
Possibly he may have settled in the house in
the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, in Aldgate Ward,
in which he was residing in 1541; or there may be some
truth in the tradition recorded by Walpole<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c020'><b>[1]</b></a> that he
lived for a time in a house on London Bridge, in close proximity to
the Steelyard, where he was much occupied in painting various members
of that colony of German merchants for the next year or two. There
is nothing to indicate that he returned to Chelsea, for the purpose of
finishing the More family picture, or that he received further commissions
from Sir Thomas and his immediate circle of friends. During
Holbein’s absence in Basel More had been made Lord Chancellor, but
had resigned that office on May 16th, 1532, which was about the time
of Holbein’s return to London. More, a generous man, had not
amassed wealth in the public service, and on relinquishing office and
the salary it carried with it, retired into private life on a modest income,
not sufficient to permit a lavish patronage of art. Two other
members of the More circle, and good friends to Holbein, Sir Henry
Guldeford, and Archbishop Warham, died in the same year, the former
in May and the latter in August, and thus the painter lost two other
patrons immediately after his return. A certain John Wolf was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>painter employed to provide the escutcheons, banners, and other
decorations for Guldeford’s funeral.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c020'><b>[2]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Whether Holbein’s appearance amid entirely new surroundings
was due to these events is doubtful. It is natural to suppose that he
would turn instinctively towards a society of fellow-countrymen,
speaking the same language, and of similar habits and modes of
thought, with whom he would feel most at home, men of comfortable
fortunes, well able to afford the luxury of sitting for their
portraits, and with the means also of finding him other remunerative
work.</p>

<p class='c023'>These merchants of the Hanseatic League in London formed a
rich corporation of considerable numerical strength, whose beginnings
went back to the very early days of English history. Some of its most
valuable privileges and trading monopolies were granted it by Richard
I and Edward III, in return for moneys lent, monopolies which
hampered English trade for centuries afterwards. This colony had
always occupied a part of the river bank above London Bridge, on the
site of what is now the South-Eastern Railway Station in Cannon
Street.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c020'><b>[3]</b></a> Their buildings were surrounded by a turreted wall, which
stretched from the river northward to Thames Street, and from Allhallows
Street on the east to Cosin (Cousins) Lane on the west, their
property extending towards Dowgate. Entrance in the principal
front in Thames Street was by three fortified gateways, above which
the Imperial double-eagle floated, and within stood their old stone
Guildhall, with a pleasant garden planted on one side with fruit trees
and vines after the fashion of their fatherland, and, to the west of the
main gate, vaults where Rhenish wine and other foreign delicacies
were sold, a favourite place of resort for English citizens as well as
foreigners. It has been generally supposed that its name, the Steelyard,
or <i>Stahlhof</i>, arose from the great weighing-machine or steelyard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>which stood within its entrance.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c020'><b>[4]</b></a> The Guildhall and Council Chamber
were situated in the western corner on Thames Street, and several
passages, including Windgoose Alley, ran from that street to the river,
giving access to the shops and small houses, the latter usually consisting
of a bedroom and sitting-room for the merchant, and, at the back,
stores and apartments for clerks and workmen. The corporation was
a close one, and the rules by which its members were bound were as
strict as those of a monastery. Within its precincts women were
strictly forbidden; all married members had to live outside the walls,
nor were guests allowed to lodge there unless also of the Hanseatic
community. Each night at nine the gates were shut, and the Steelyard
was then like a small walled German town in the midst of London.
The breaking of its laws, or the practice of any bad habits, was followed
by severe punishment. Its members, too, were obliged to take their
share in the wider civic life of London. The Steelyard was represented
by an Alderman and a Deputy, and, among other duties, each
merchant had his allotted post in case of war, and was obliged to keep
the necessary arms ready for the defence of the city.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f3'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The buildings of the Steelyard were finally pulled down
in the autumn of 1863, and the ground was excavated immediately
afterwards. The Cannon Street Railway Station covers approximately the
whole site of the Steelyard except the strip on the north front cut
off for the widening of Upper Thames Street. See Philip Norman, “Notes
on the Later History of the Steelyard in London,” <i>Archæologia</i>,
vol. lxi. pt. ii. (1909), pp. 389-426; Wykeham Archer, <i>Once a
Week</i>, vol. v. (1861); J. E. Price, <i>Transactions of the London
and Middlesex Archæological Society</i>, vol. iii. 67 (1870). See also
for the whole history of the Steelyard, Lappenberg, <i>Urkundliche
Geschichte des Hansischen Stahlhofes zu London</i>, Hamburg, 1851.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f4'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. Norman, however, considers that it has nothing to do
with a weighing-machine, but that it is an Anglicised form of the
German “Stahlhof.” See his paper in <i>Archæologia</i>, quoted on the
preceding page.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Their privileges were so great that they had always been unpopular,
and this dislike grew in strength until the reign of Henry VIII, when
the first attempts were made to break up their monopolies, which
ended, some sixty years later, in their complete overthrow. When
Holbein first came among them, however, they still occupied the foremost
place in the commercial life of London, and were an exceedingly
rich and prosperous community. They served the King and Court in
more ways than one, for they were constantly made use of for the
despatch of letters abroad and for the translation of communications
received from foreign countries. They made arrangements with their
agents in Europe for the payment of the diets and other expenses of
Henry’s ambassadors and special messengers, and much confidential
continental news was received through their business houses. Books,
prints, and various rare and artistic objects were also forwarded to
them for delivery to the English court. Thomas Cromwell, in particular,
made much use of them in the sending and receiving of
foreign correspondence. They also entertained all important visitors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>artists, craftsmen, and others of their own countrymen who visited
England.</p>

<p class='c023'>Holbein, however, does not appear to have come into contact with
them during his first visit to England; no portrait, at least, of a Steelyard
merchant of that date has survived, though he painted Niklaus
Kratzer, who must have known many of them intimately. Possibly
his introduction to them in 1532 was due to his friendship with the
German astronomer. In any case, between 1532 and 1536, he painted
a considerable number of them, chiefly small half-length portraits, in
which the sitter is shown in his own room or office, dressed in sober
black, with the accessories of his work scattered round him, and with
letters in front of him containing his name and his address at the
Steelyard. These portraits were most probably painted for presentation
by the sitters to the League of which they were leading members,
to be hung on the walls of the Council Chamber of their Guildhall,
rather than for the purpose of sending them to family relations abroad.
This would account for the presence of several of them in England to-day,
for when the Guild was finally broken up in 1598 and much of
its property scattered far and wide, some of the portraits remained in
this country while others found their way abroad.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF GEORG GISZE</div>
<p class='c023'>The portrait of Georg Gisze, now in the Berlin Museum (No. 586)
(<a href='#pl-01'>Pl. 1</a>),<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c020'><b>[5]</b></a> was one of the first, if not the first, of these likenesses of
Steelyard merchants to be painted by Holbein. This portrait is not
only the most elaborate work of the whole series, but the sitter was
also one of the most important members of the League then in London.
His name is spelt in more than one way on the picture itself, and other
versions of it are to be found in the English State Papers. In the
letter from his brother, which he holds in his hand, he is addressed,
according to the Berlin Catalogue, as Jerg Gisze. The full address
is “Dem erszamen Jergen Gisze to lunden in engelant mynen broder
to handen.” Below the motto on the wall, beneath the shelf on
the left—“Nulla sine merore voluptas”—in the sitter’s own handwriting,
is the signature G. Gisze or Gyze. It has been read both

followed by a long <i>s</i>, or, as two connected strokes representing
the letter <i>y</i>. On other letters from foreign correspondents,
tucked behind the wall-rails on the right, his name is also spelt
Gisse and Ghisse, while in the

it appears in its Latinised form of Gysen. This distich, which also
contains the date and the sitter’s age, runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c023'>In days when spelling was largely phonetic it is not surprising to
find proper names spelt in a variety of ways, and the Hanse merchants,
in particular, received letters from correspondents in all parts of the
world, speaking a variety of languages and dialects. According to
the Berlin Catalogue, Georg Gisze was born on 2nd April 1497, so that
he was of Holbein’s own age, and died in February 1562, and was a
member of a leading Danzig family. Woltmann regarded him as a
Swiss, and states that there was a family called Gysin settled in the
neighbourhood of Basel, and that the name is still to be seen on numerous
sign-boards in the adjacent small town of Liestall.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c020'><b>[6]</b></a> Miss Hervey,
on the other hand, suggests that, however the name may be spelt, it
was probably a variation of that of Gueiss, which was one of the most
distinguished in the annals of the Steelyard.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c020'><b>[7]</b></a> The family belonged
to Cologne, and Albert von Gueiss was a representative of the Steelyard
at the Conference held at Bruges in 1520. In at least one entry
in the Steelyard records this name is spelt Gisse. She suggests, therefore,
that Georg Gisze may have been a younger brother or a son of
this Albert von Gueiss. In his book on Holbein’s “Ambassadors”
picture, Mr. W. F. Dickes, who, in his anxiety to prove that Holbein
was not in England in 1532, conveniently ignores the evidence of the
letter which Gisze holds in his hand, addressed to him “in London,”
conclusive proof that the portrait was produced in this country, is of
opinion that it was painted in Basel.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c020'><b>[8]</b></a> Little is known of its history
since it left the walls of the Guildhall in Thames Street. It was in the
Orleans Collection in 1727, and was purchased at the sale of that
collection by Christian von Mechel.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c020'><b>[9]</b></a> Various attempts to induce the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Basel Library to buy it proved unavailing. It was afterwards for a
time in Basel, and in 1821 was added to the Solly Collection, passing
later into the Berlin Gallery.</p>

<p class='c023'>The first time the name of Georg Gisze occurs in the English State
Papers is in 1522,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c020'><b>[10]</b></a> when he was twenty-four years of age. The paper
is an English translation of a protection, dated Lyon, 26 June 1522,
granted by Francis I to Gerrard van Werden, George Hasse, Henry
Melman, Geo. Gyse, Geo. Strowse, Elard Smetyng, Hans Colynbrowgh,
and Perpoynt Deovanter, merchants of the Hanse, during the war
between him, the Emperor, and England. They are forbidden to deal
in wheat, salt, “ollrons,” harness, and weapons of war. Deovanter
appears to have been one of the leading merchants. At this period
he went as a representative of the Steelyard on several missions to
Francis for the purpose of the recovery of goods taken from their ships
by the Captain of Boulogne. During his absence he gave power of
attorney in a suit of his against George Byrom, of Salford, to several
friends and fellow-merchants, among them “George Guyse,” and,
it is interesting to note, “Th. Crumwell, of London, gent.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c020'><b>[11]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The next reference to Gisze is at Michaelmas, 1533, in a letter from
Thomas Houth to the Earl of Kildare in Ireland,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c020'><b>[12]</b></a> respecting the death
of a certain John Wolff, in which, speaking of some bills, he says,—“I
ascertained at the Steelyard that the handwriting was his, by the
evidence of Geo. Gyes, the alderman’s deputy, and others.” This
letter proves that Gisze held an important position in the Steelyard,
as Deputy to the Alderman, who was probably Barthold Beckman, of
Hamburg.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c020'><b>[13]</b></a> Possibly his appointment to this position occasioned the
painting of his portrait.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF GEORG GISZE</div>
<p class='c023'>The portrait is life-size, and half-length, the sitter being turned
to the right, the face towards the spectator, and the eyes turned slightly
to the left. He is wearing a flat black cap over his fair hair, which is
cut straight across the forehead and covers the ears; and a dress of
rose-coloured silk with a sleeveless overcoat of black, and a fine white
linen shirt. He is seated behind a table covered with a cloth of Eastern
design, and is in the act of opening his brother’s letter. By him, on
the table, stands a tall vase of Venetian glass with twisted handles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>filled with carnations, and scattered in front of him are various objects
used in his business, a seal, inkstand, scissors, quill pens, a leather case
with metal bands and clasps, and a box containing money. From the
shelves on the walls hang scales for weighing gold, a seal attached to
a long chain, and a metal ball for string, with a damascened design and
a band with the words “<span class='fss'>HEER EN</span>” repeated round it.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c020'><b>[14]</b></a> Books
and a box are upon the shelves, and tucked within the narrow wooden
bars which run round the walls are parchment tags for seals and several
letters with addresses in High German. On these occur the dates
1528 and 1531, while the names of the correspondents with which they
are endorsed can be more or less clearly discerned, as well as the word
“England.” Woltmann reads the names as “Tomas Bandz,”
“Jergen ze Basel,” and “Hans Stolten.” This last letter is marked
with the writer’s particular device, which also occurs on a second letter,
and is very similar to the device on the letter in the picture of Derich
Tybis in Vienna. The walls of his room are painted in greyish green,
the paint shown as rubbed and discoloured here and there, and along
the bars and shelves, which have been worn by constant use.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f14'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the inventory of the goods of John Wolff, attached to
the letter mentioned above, a similar ball is included—“a round ball
gilt for sealing thread to hang out of to seal withal.” <i>C.L.P.</i>,
vol. vi. 1170.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The painting of the numerous details is wonderful in its accurate
realism, showing the closest observation and an evident delight in
their perfect rendering. It has been suggested, as the picture contains
many more accessories than in his other portraits of members of the
Steelyard, that Holbein took particular pains with it as the first of a
possible series, and that it was a kind of “show-piece,” in order that
his clients might see of what he was capable. This superb portrait,
which is in a better state of preservation than most of Holbein’s existing
works, is finer in its clear, luminous colour and more delicate in
its drawing than any other of his pictures of this period. It is almost
Flemish in the minuteness and care of its finish and in its cool, clear
tones. All the objects of still-life which surround the sitter, which
are placed about him as naturally as though the artist had come upon
him suddenly when engaged upon his daily business, and had there
and then painted him, without arranging or posing, whether of silk,
or linen, or gold, or steel, or glass, are painted with a fidelity to nature
never excelled by the Dutchmen or Flemings of the following century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>who devoted their whole career to the rendering of still-life. In
Holbein’s portrait, however, all these carefully-wrought minor details,
beautiful in themselves as they may be, in no way force themselves
on the attention to the detriment of the portrait itself, which stands
out as a vivid representation of the sitter’s personality, in which the
essentials of his character have been seen with an unerring eye, and
set down upon the panel with an unerring hand. We get here the
young German merchant to the very life, precise, deliberate and orderly
in the transaction of his affairs, with strongly-marked German features,
long nose, and determined chin, a living presentment which only a
master could have produced.</p>

<p class='c023'>Ruskin’s glowing description of the picture is well known, but it
is so true and so eloquent that a sentence from it may be quoted:—</p>

<p class='c025'>“Every accessory is perfect with a fine perfection; the carnations
in the glass by his side; the ball of gold, chased with blue enamel,
suspended on the wall; the books, the steelyard, the papers on the
table, the seal ring with its quartered bearings—all intensely there,
and there in beauty of which no one could have dreamed that even
flowers or gold were capable, far less parchment or steel. But every
change of shade is felt, every rich and rubied line of petal followed,
every subdued gleam in the soft blue of the enamel and bending of the
gold touched with a hand whose patience of regard creates rather than
paints. The jewel itself was not so precious as the rays of enduring
light which form it, beneath that errorless hand. The man himself
what he was—not more; but to all conceivable proof of sight, in all
aspect of life or thought—not less. He sits alone in his accustomed
room, his common work laid out before him; he is conscious of no
presence, assumes no dignity, bears no sudden or superficial look of
care or interest, lives only as he lived—but for ever. It is inexhaustible.
Every detail of it wins, retains, rewards the attention with a
continually increasing sense of wonderfulness. It is also wholly true.
So far as it reaches, it contains the absolute facts of colour, form, and
character, rendered with an unaccusable faithfulness.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c020'><b>[15]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF HANS OF ANTWERP</div>
<p class='c023'>The portrait of Hans of Antwerp, in Windsor Castle (<a href='#pl-02'>Pl. 2</a>),<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c020'><b>[16]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>belongs to the summer of the same year, 1532, and was one of the earliest
of the Steelyard series. It is in oil on panel, and has darkened with age,
and has suffered to some extent from repaintings. It represents the
half-length figure of a middle-aged man, about three-quarters the size of
life. He is turned to the right, seated at a table, upon which his elbows
rest, and he is about to cut the string of a letter with a long knife. He
has thick bushy hair and beard, brown in colour, and brown eyes, and
is wearing a dark overcoat, which may have been originally dark green
in colour, edged with a broad band of brown fur, and beneath it a brown
dress and a white shirt with the collar embroidered with black Spanish
work. On his head is a flat black cap. The table is covered with a
dark green cloth, and upon it, in front of him, are placed a pad of paper
with a quill pen resting on it, some coins and a seal engraved with the
letter W. The head, strongly lightened, stands out against a background
of grey-brown wall, with a strip of darker colour on the
right-hand side of the panel. He wears a signet ring on the first
finger of his left hand, and a smaller ring on the little finger of
the right.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f16'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, 265. Reproduced by Law, <i>Holbein’s Pictures

46; Ganz, <i>Holbein</i>, p. 96.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The letter which he holds in his hand has a superscription in
crabbed Teutonic writing, which Woltmann, after careful examination,
deciphered as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Dem ersamen H[a]nnsen</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Von Anwerpen ... lo [....] vpn</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Stallhoff zv h[anden].</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The parts in brackets are hidden in the original by the knife, and have
been added conjecturally by him, so that the whole inscription would
run in English: “To the honourable Hans of Antwerp in London,
in the Steelyard, these to hand.” The words “ersamen” and “Stallhoff”
are distinct, but the “Anwerpen” is less clear, and only the first
letter of the Christian name is certain.</p>
<p class='c023'>The brown under-dress the sitter is wearing certainly has some
appearance of the leather apron worn by goldsmiths which Woltmann
declared it to be;<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c020'><b>[17]</b></a> and this, together with the gold coins on the table,
such as goldsmiths were in the habit of exhibiting in their shops, he
regarded as additional proof that the portrait represents the goldsmith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Hans of Antwerp, Holbein’s close friend and one of his executors.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c020'><b>[18]</b></a>
There is considerable probability that this ascription is correct, though
it is by no means absolutely certain. On the paper-pad lying on the
table there is an inscription, evidently in the sitter’s handwriting, giving
his age and the date. Even this inscription is not absolutely clear.
Woltmann reads it:—</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f17'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, i. p. 368. An under-dress of similar fashion,
however, is worn by nearly all Holbein’s Steelyard sitters.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f18'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It should be noted, however, that similar coins appear in
the box on the table in the portrait of Georg Gisze.</p>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

      <div class='line in3'>Ætatis suæ ...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The second “<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>,” however, is evidently wrong. Mr. Law<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c020'><b>[19]</b></a> reads
it as a possible “Aug.” for August, and is doubtful about the word
“Julii.” Both these writers fail to decipher the sitter’s age, but it
appears to be “53,” or, perhaps, “33,” the latter agreeing better with
the apparent age of the sitter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c023'>The W. on the seal affords some evidence against the portrait being
that of John of Antwerp. Woltmann calls it “the device of his trading
house,” and in this Mr. Law follows him. It is much more probable,
however, that it is the initial of his surname. The seal is of a similar
shape to those in the portraits of Georg Gisze and Derich Tybis. In the
former the lettering is illegible, but in the latter it is plainly “D. T.”
Before Hans of Antwerp’s surname was known, Woltmann’s suggestion
was not out of place, but Mr. Lionel Cust<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c020'><b>[20]</b></a> has recently discovered
it to have been Van der Gow, which does not accord with the letter on
the seal. Among the numerous references to John of Antwerp in the
State Papers and elsewhere he is never once spoken of as belonging to
the Steelyard, whereas the picture in question is in all probability a
portrait of some merchant of the Hanseatic League. More than one
German merchant of the Steelyard whose surname began with W is
mentioned in the records, such as Gerard van Werden and Ulric Wise,
while one of the leading jewellers of Henry’s reign was Morgan Wolf,
though he was almost certainly a Welshman. However, until further
evidence is forthcoming, the name Hans of Antwerp must stand as
the sitter for this portrait, and it has much in its favour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF HANS OF ANTWERP</div>
<p class='c023'>As the friend and witness and administrator of Holbein’s will, the
question of the true portrait of John of Antwerp is of unusual interest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The two men appear to have been closely associated, and there is no
doubt that Holbein supplied him with designs. One such design is
well known—the drawing for a beautiful drinking-cup in the Basel
Gallery upon which is inscribed the name “Hans Von Ant....”
(<a href='#pl-42'>Pl. 42</a>).<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c020'><b>[21]</b></a> Mr. Lionel Cust conjectures that the cup given by Cromwell
to the King on New Year’s Day, 1539, made by John of Antwerp, was
this identical cup; but it hardly appears probable that an object made
for such a purpose would have the maker’s name placed upon it so
prominently on a broad band running round its centre. It may be
suggested that it is more likely to have been intended by the maker
for presentation to the Hanseatic League to form part of the corporation
plate of that body kept in the Guildhall of the Steelyard.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>John of Antwerp’s name occurs frequently in the private accounts
of Thomas Cromwell for the years 1537-39, and Mr. Lionel Cust has
gathered together much interesting information about him. In a
letter from Cromwell to the Goldsmiths’ Company we learn that he
had been settled in London since 1515, but the first reference to him
Mr. Cust finds is in March 1537, in the Privy Purse Expenses of the
Princess Mary, which runs: “Item payed for goldsmythes workes for
my ladies grace to John of Andwarpe iiij <i>li</i>, xvij <i>s</i>, vij <i>d</i>.” There is,
however, an earlier reference, and one of considerable interest, in the
State Papers, in a letter from one Richard Cavendish to the Duke of
Suffolk, dated Norton, 5th June 1534, which shows that John Van
Andwerp was at that time employed with a certain Hans De Fromont
in searching for a gold mine at Norton. “They are,” says Cavendish,
“applying themselves with diligence to find the mine. Here is the
greatest diversity of earth and stones, for the stones in the gravel in
most places appear to be very gold. Many assays have been made
to prove it, but nothing found as yet, and it is believed the glitter ‘is
but the scum of the metal which groweth beneath the ground.’ They
have now begun to dig pits to get at the principal vein. The people
are as glad as ever he saw to further the matter, for in old evidences
the place is called Golden Norton, which proves that gold may be
found there. He sees no great forwardness as yet, but prays God they
may find some.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c020'><b>[22]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Cromwell employed him in a number of ways. In December 1537<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c020'><b>[23]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>he received 15<i>s.</i> for setting a great ruby, and 29<i>s.</i> for
the gold in the ring.
In November 1538<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c020'><b>[24]</b></a> he was at work on the cup already mentioned for
a New Year’s Gift to Henry, for which purpose he received 52 oz. of
gold, and was paid nearly £20. Other work during these years consisted
in making a George, setting stones in rings, making chains and
trenchers, and repairing various Georges, Garters, and other jewellery
belonging to the Lord Privy Seal, full details of which will be found in

in which the foreign traders in England were frequently employed by

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r27'>27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Cust suggests that this message was addressed to
Holbein. He says: “At Lady Day, 1539, he (Holbein) seems to have been
still absent (in Basel), though he was back in England before
Midsummer.” (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, February 1906, p. 359.) This,
however, is not probable. Holbein was certainly back from Basel by
December 1538, when he received £10 for his journey to Upper Burgundy,
and he presented a portrait of Prince Edward to the King on New Year’s
Day, 1539. He received no salary on Lady Day, 1539, because he had
already received a year’s wages in advance at Midsummer, 1538, to date
from the previous Lady Day, and not because he was out of England. At
this period messages and money were being constantly sent to
Christopher Mount, who was much abroad on missions to the German
Protestant princes, and the question of the marriage with Cleves was
only one of the many affairs, and one of the least important, upon
which he was then engaged.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In 1537 Hans of Antwerp’s name occurs in the return for Subsidies of
Aliens in England, among foreigners dwelling in the parish of St.
Nicholas Acon, as “John Andwarpe, straunger, xxx <i>li.</i>, xxx
<i>s.</i>” In a similar list for the same parish in 1541 he is given
for the first time his proper name: “John Vander Gow, <i>alias</i>
John Andwerp, in goodes, xxx <i>li.</i>, xxx <i>s.</i>” Mr. Cust
suggests that his name may have been Van der Goes. This assessment of
his goods at £30 and the tax on it of thirty shillings was the
customary rate for foreigners. Nicholas Lyzarde, Elizabeth’s
serjeant-painter,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c020'><b>[28]</b></a> was assessed to the same amount—but Holbein was
taxed at the higher rate of £3 on his salary of £30, as it was the
custom to tax “lands, fees and annuities” at double the rate of goods.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF HANS OF ANTWERP</div>
<p class='c023'>In April of the same year Van der Gow was anxious to obtain the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>freedom of the Goldsmiths’ Company as a step towards being admitted
to the right of citizenship in London. Cromwell’s letter, recommending
him to the Company “most hartely,” states that he had already lived
twenty-six years in London, had married an Englishwoman, by whom
he had many children, and purposed continuing in London for the rest
of his life. This desire to become a naturalised Englishman might be
taken as some evidence that he was not a member of the Steelyard
confraternity.</p>

<p class='c023'>From the register of the church of St. Nicholas Acon, in Lombard
Street, where the goldsmiths have always congregated, we learn that
he had a son, Augustine Anwarpe, baptized on 27th November 1542,
and a second son, Roger, on 10th December 1547; that on three
successive days in September 1543 three of his servants, John
Ducheman, Jane, his maid, and Richard, were buried; that a fourth
servant was buried on the 10th August 1548; and that his son Augustine
was buried on 1st July 1550.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c020'><b>[29]</b></a> There can be little doubt that the
three servants died of the plague which was raging in London in
September 1543. Holbein was almost certainly another of its victims,
and Mr. Cust suggests that he may very probably have caught the
infection in John Van der Gow’s house.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f29'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These facts are taken from Mr. Cust’s paper.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The portrait, it is to be supposed, like Holbein’s other representations
of Steelyard merchants, was very possibly presented to the Guild,
and would remain hanging in their Guildhall until they were expelled
by Elizabeth in 1598. “When in 1606,” says Woltmann, quoting
from Lappenberg, “under James I, the Steelyard was given back to
its possessors, the rooms were found in an evil condition, and all
movables, such as tables, seats, bedsteads, and even panels and glass
windows, were almost entirely stolen. That under such circumstances
a sparing hand watched over the pictures is scarcely to be expected.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c020'><b>[30]</b></a>
The portrait of Hans of Antwerp, whatever its earlier adventures may
have been, was in the collection of Charles I, in which it was No. 29,
and is described in his catalogue as: “Done by Holbein. <i>Item.</i>
Upon a cracked board, the picture of a merchant, in a black cap and
habit having a letter with a knife in his hand cutting the seal thread
of the letter; a seal lying by on a green table; bought by Sir Harry
Vane and given to the King.” The crack in the panel is still plainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>visible. It was valued by the Commonwealth Commissioners at £100,
and sold for that sum. It reappears, however, in James II’s catalogue,
No. 499: “By Holbein. A man’s head, in a black cap, with a
letter and penknife in his hand.” It is possible that it is the picture
by “Holbin” of “a Dutchman sealing a letter,” which was in the Duke
of Buckingham’s collection at York House in 1635,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c020'><b>[31]</b></a> from which it
may have passed into that of Charles I. The picture, though it has
not the richness and transparency of colour of the “Gisze,” or its
extreme delicacy of execution and luxuriance of detail, is a vigorous
and life-like representation of a somewhat stolid German, painted with
the truth and sincerity which Holbein brought to everything he
touched.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAITS OF TWO OF THE WEDIGHS</div>
<p class='c023'>The two small roundels, which hitherto have always been regarded
as likenesses of Holbein himself, undoubtedly represent, as
Dr. Ganz has recently pointed out, the same individual as the
sitter in the Windsor picture, who, until his identity is finally
settled, it is most convenient to call Hans of Antwerp. The first
is the beautiful little painting on oak in the Salting collection,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c020'><b>[32]</b></a> in
which the sitter is shown in full-face, with a flat black cap, a gown
lined with light-coloured fur, and a dark under-coat or vest, cut straight
across the top, as in most of Holbein’s other Steelyard portraits. The
left hand only is shown, with a ring on the first finger. On the background
on either side of the head is the faded inscription “<span class='fss'>ETATIS
SVÆ 35</span>.” It was possibly painted a year or two later than the
Windsor portrait, to which the likeness is very marked. If, however,
the sitter really represents Hans of Antwerp, and he was painted a
second time by Holbein about 1534-5, when 35 years of age, he must
have been only a boy when he settled in London in 1515. The second
roundel is in Lord Spencer’s collection at Althorp,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c020'><b>[33]</b></a> and this, too, has
always been regarded as a portrait of Holbein by himself. Here again
the likeness to the Windsor picture is a strong one, though the opposite
side of the face is seen, as he is shown in three-quarters profile to the
spectator’s left. There are slight variations in the dress, the undervest
being lower, and disclosing more of the white shirt. Some critics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>regard it as a genuine work by Holbein, but Dr. Ganz places it among
the doubtful and wrongly-attributed pictures. He suggests that it
is probably one of the two roundels considered to be self-portraits by
Holbein which C. van Mander saw in Amsterdam in 1604, and was
engraved by A. Stock as such in 1612 and published by H. Hondius.
There is a replica of it in the Provinzial Museum in Hanover.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c020'><b>[34]</b></a> All
three works evidently represent the same man, and at about the same
age.</p>

<p class='c023'>In the same year, 1532, he painted another goldsmith, Hans von
Zürich, but the picture has disappeared, and is now only known from
the engraving Hollar made of it in 1647, when it was in the Arundel
collection. In the engraving he is shown at half-length, full-face,
the body turned slightly to the left, and is a thin man, with a pleasant
expression. It is inscribed on the top: “Hans von Zürch, Goltshmidt.
Hans Holbein, 1532,” and below, “W. Hollar fecit, 1647, ex collectione
Arundeliana,” and has a dedication by the publisher, H. Vander Borcht,
to Matthäus Merian.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c020'><b>[35]</b></a> The date indicates that Hans von Zürich must
have been living in London at that time, though his name does not
occur in the State Papers.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>One other portrait of a German merchant by Holbein was painted
in the year 1532.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c020'><b>[36]</b></a> It is in the collection of Count von Schönborn in
Vienna, and is one of a pair of portraits of brothers or near relations,
members of the Wedigh family of Cologne.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c020'><b>[37]</b></a> They hung together until
1865, in which year the finer one of the two, dated 1533, was acquired
by Herr B. Suermondt, of Aix-la-Chapelle, and is now in the Berlin
Gallery, having been purchased in 1874, together with another fine
portrait by Holbein of an unknown young man, from the Suermondt
collection. The close relationship of the two sitters is proved by the
exactly similar coat of arms on the enamelled ring each one is wearing.
In the first edition of his book Woltmann gave it as his opinion that
they were Englishmen, but afterwards came to the conclusion that
both portraits represented German Steelyard merchants. The belief
that they were Englishmen was afterwards strengthened by a communication
to the Berlin authorities from Privy Councillor Dielitz, who,
from the coat of arms on the rings, held that the pictures represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>two members of the English family of Trelawney. This ascription,
however, has been proved to be wrong, and it may be pointed out
that the motto inscribed on the paper projecting from the book in
the Vienna portrait,—“Veritas odium parit” (“Truth brings hatred”),
is not the present motto of the Trelawney family. On the side of the
same book, painted on the edges of the leaves, are the letters “<span class='fss'>H E R.
W I D.</span>,” and more recent research has established the fact that the
two men were members of the Wedigh family. Members of this patrician
family of Cologne had been connected with the London Steelyard
since 1480. In this connection it is interesting to note that the seal
in the so-called “Hans of Antwerp” picture is engraved with the
letter “W,” which suggests some possibility that he, too, may have
been a Wedigh.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The 1532 picture in the Schönborn collection is a small half-length.
The subject, who is seated at the back of a table, is turned to the right,
with head almost full-front and looking at the spectator. His right
arm rests on the table, and he holds his gloves in his left hand. His
hair, cut straight across his forehead, covers his ears, and he is clean-shaven.
He is wearing the usual dark overcoat with deep fur collar,
and an inner collar or lining of lighter fur, opened sufficiently to show
a part of his embroidered under-dress, the sleeves of which are of watered
or patterned silk, and a white pleated shirt gathered round the neck
in a small frill. The customary flat black cap is on his head. On the
table to the left is a leather-bound book with two clasps, with the
artist’s initials on the cover, and a piece of paper projecting from
between the leaves on which is written the Latin motto already quoted.
On the plain blue background is inscribed on either side of the head,
“<span class='fss'>ANNO. 1532.</span>” and “<span class='fss'>ÆTATIS.SVÆ. 29.</span>” It is a sympathetic and
simple rendering of a young man of serious expression, in which both
the beardless face, of a somewhat reddish complexion, and the two
hands are very finely painted. Woltmann conjectured that the Latin
motto indicated that the book on the table might be one of those writings
which the German reformers were at that time busily engaged
in smuggling into England, the secret dissemination of which neither
Wolsey or More could stay, in spite of the drastic methods they employed
to stamp it out. Although possessing many privileges, the men
of the Steelyard were by no means free from persecutions of this nature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF HERMANN WEDIGH</div>
<p class='c023'>The companion picture, in the Berlin Gallery (No. 586<span class='fss'>B</span>) (<a href='#pl-03'>Pl. 3</a>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>represents Hermann Hillebrandt Wedigh.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c020'><b>[38]</b></a> Like that of his brother, it is
a small half-length. He stands directly facing the spectator, the left
hand holding his buff-coloured gloves, and the right half hidden by the
heavy dark-brown cloak, with black velvet collar and velvet at the
wrists, the folds of which are finely arranged and painted. This cloak
lacks the customary fur collar. The white shirt, partly open and showing
the bare chest beneath, is tied in the front by long strings passed
through a white button, and the embroidered collar is almost hidden
by his beard. A flat black cap is on his head, of the type worn by all
the Steelyard merchants in Holbein’s portraits. The hair, beard, and
long moustache are fair, the separate hairs being indicated with almost
microscopic care. The eyes are brown, the left one being decidedly
smaller than the right, and there is a corresponding difference in the
development of the two sides of the face. There are no accessories
of any kind, and upon the plain blue background, on either side of
the head, is inscribed, in gold letters: “<span class='fss'>ANNO. 1533</span>.” and “<span class='fss'>ÆTATIS
SVÆ. 39</span>.” The gold ring is enamelled in red, white and black, and
in the circle round the coat of arms there are some letters now undecipherable.
This is one of the finest and most sympathetic portraits
ever painted by Holbein. The face, in spite of its slight irregularity,
is one of great charm and much sweetness of expression. The drawing
of the hands and mouth is particularly fine.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c020'><b>[39]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f39'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Dickes, who does not hesitate to suggest that a date
has been tampered with if it suits his argument to do so, regards this
picture as “an unmistakable portrait of the second person” in the
“Ambassadors” picture, such person being, in his opinion Philipp,
Count Palatine. This picture, he says, “has a damaged date, catalogued
as 1533, and a more clear “ætatis 34,” which is no doubt correct, for
the moustache shows five years’ more growth” (<i>i.e.</i> than in the
“Ambassadors”). “No one who compares the two faces can doubt the
identity, or that if of Philipp—born November 12, 1503, as indicated
in our picture—its correct date is 1538.” It requires a very vivid
imagination to see a likeness between Wedigh and the portrait of the
Bishop of Lavaur in the National Gallery group; but Mr. Dickes sees
Philipp and Otto Henry in so many portraits scattered about Europe,
having but the faintest resemblance to one another, and gives to
Holbein so many pictures he never painted, and takes from him at least
one of his finest works (the Morette in Dresden, which he calls Otto
Henry and attributes to Amberger) that his attribution with regard to
the Wedigh portrait is not worth serious consideration. The date upon
it is plainly enough 1533. At the time he was writing his book the age
of the sitter appeared to be “34,” but recent cleaning shows it to be
“39.” (Dickes, <i>Holbein’s “Ambassadors” Unriddled</i>, p. 81.)</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Three other portraits of Steelyard merchants bear the date 1533:
Derich Born at Windsor, Derich Tybis at Vienna, and Cyriacus Fallen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>at Brunswick. The portrait of Derich Born (<a href='#pl-04a'>Pl. 4 (1)</a>),<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c020'><b>[40]</b></a> in the royal
collection at Windsor Castle, painted when he was twenty-three, is,
after the “Gisze” and “Hermann Wedigh” portraits, perhaps the
most attractive of the Steelyard series. It is slightly under life-size,
the figure shown nearly to the waist, turned to the right, and the head,
upon which the light falls strongly from above on the right, nearly
in full-face. His right elbow rests on a stone ledge or parapet which
runs across the picture, the left hand placed across the right wrist, and
a gold signet-ring with a coat of arms on his forefinger. He wears a
flat black cap, black silk dress, and a white shirt with a collar of so-called
Spanish work of black silk thread, very delicately painted. He
is beardless, and has chestnut-brown hair, cut straight across the forehead
and hiding the ears in the customary fashion.</p>

<p class='c023'>On the flat stonework below the ledge on which his arm rests is

<p class='c025'>(“If you were to add a voice this would be Derich, his very self; and

<p class='c023'>The background is of a dark greenish blue against which stand out
some branches and leaves of a vine or fig tree. It is painted in cool and
delicate tones, with flesh tints of a pale brown, in which it bears a
close resemblance to the portrait of Georg Gisze. It is marked, too,
by the same simplicity and restraint, and air of quiet and dignified
repose, and searching truth and insight in the rendering of what must
have been a very attractive nature, qualities which make Holbein’s
portraiture so great.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF DERICH BORN</div>
<p class='c023'>This is the only one of several portraits of the series without letters
or papers bearing the name and address of the sitter which can be
said with absolute certainty to represent one of the London Steelyard
merchants. Mr. W. F. Dickes suggests that it represents the eldest
son and successor of Theodorichus de Born, the printer, of Deventer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and Nimeguen, who issued the Netherland New Testament in 1532,
and he quotes a reference to a Theodorichus de Born de Novimagio
acting as Secretary to the Faculty of Arts at Cologne University, and
also to a Derichus de Born who had a licence to preach. “Remembering,”
he says, “that Erasmus spent his schooldays at Deventer,
and that Holbein owed to him several of his introductions, I think my
suggestion deserves to be considered. At any rate, there is no necessity
to assume, as is done without a tittle of evidence, that this young
scholar was a member of the Stahlhof! Nor does the presence of this
portrait at Windsor prove that it was painted in England.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c020'><b>[41]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Mr. Dickes, whose chief object is to prove, for the purposes of his
theory about the “Ambassadors,” that none of these Steelyard portraits
was painted in England, starts by misquoting the inscription
on the picture, which he gives as “Derichus si vocem addas de Born,”
an extraordinary mixing of the first and third lines. There is no “de
Born” in it, it is distinctly “Der. Born,” and though the young man
depicted may have been a member of Theodorichus de Born’s family,
as he suggests, he was certainly a member of the Steelyard, and known
in London as Derich Born. In the Calendars of Letters and Papers,
under the heading of “Ordnance,” a paper is printed which gives a
list of “payments made by Erasmus Kyrkenar, the King’s armourer,
by his Majesty’s command, from 15th Sept, to 13th Oct. 28 Hen.
VIII” (1536), for wages of armourers, and the providing of armour,
harness, &amp;c., in connection with the Rebellion in the North. Among
the items included in his account is the following:</p>

<p class='c023'>“For various bundles of harness bought of Mr. Locke, merchant
of London, and of <i>Dyrycke Borne, merchant of the Steelyard</i>,” &amp;c.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c020'><b>[42]</b></a>
This, though it does not actually prove him to have been in London
in 1533, shows that he was most certainly here three years later as a
member of the Steelyard. Evidence of his presence in London in the
years 1542-49 is to be found in the <i>Inventare hansischer Archive
des 16. Jahrhunderts, I</i>, quoted by Dr. Ganz,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c020'><b>[43]</b></a> who states that he was
a merchant of Cologne.</p>

<p class='c023'>The picture is on oak, 1 ft. 11½ in. high by 1 ft. 7¼ in. wide. It
was at one time in the Arundel collection, and is entered in the 1655
inventory as “Derichius a Born.” It is possible that the earl owned
more than one of the Steelyard portraits, for there are two entries of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>portraits of men with black birettas. On the back is the brand of
Charles I, “C.R.” crowned, though it is not described in his catalogue.
There is a second portrait of Derich Born by Holbein, a small oval
of about 3 in. high (9 × 8 mm.), on paper, in the Alte Pinakothek at
Munich, giving the head and shoulders only.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c020'><b>[44]</b></a> It is painted in oil on
paper, and has suffered somewhat from retouching, but is still an
excellent example of the small portraits in oil on wood or paper, usually
enclosed in a case of wood or ivory, which Holbein was fond of painting
at this period, closely akin to his true miniatures of a rather later
date. In the Munich version the position is reversed, the sitter being
turned to the right, and the face not quite so fully to the front. The
workmanship, more particularly of the collar, is as fine as in the larger
Windsor portrait. His name and age and the date are given, but the
last figures and letters have been cut away, probably when fitting it
into the frame, so that all that is left of the inscription on the background,
on either side of the head, now reads:</p>

<p class='c022'>There is every probability that the completed date was 1533, and
that the little picture was produced at about the same time as the
Windsor version, though the sitter looks slightly younger, and while
the more important work was painted for a place on the walls of the
Hanse Guildhall, the lesser one may well have been done for sending
to the sitter’s relations abroad. The Munich catalogue states that it
is from the Elector Palatine’s palace at Mannheim, but otherwise
nothing is known of its history.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF DERICH TYBIS</div>
<p class='c023'>The half-length portrait of Derich Tybis, of Duisburg (<a href='#pl-04b'>Pl. 4 (2)</a>), about
half the size of life, in the Vienna Gallery (No. 1485), is of the same
date, 1533.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c020'><b>[45]</b></a> It is a full-face representation of a young man, with dark
brown eyes and hair, his double chin and upper lip being clean-shaven
and tinged with blue. In his hands, which rest on a table in front of
him, he is holding a letter which he is about to open. He wears the
usual heavy, black, sleeveless cloak or overcoat, with a deep collar
of fur, and a smaller inner collar of lighter fur. The fore-sleeves of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>under-dress are of dark-brown velvet. The open fur collar allows a
glimpse of a finely-pleated white shirt, with a neck-band of a conventional
design of holly leaves worked in gold thread in place
of the more usual black Spanish embroidery. He wears two rings
on the forefinger of his left hand, one with an oval green stone in a claw
setting. The table is covered with an olive-green cloth, and lying upon
it are a second letter, a paper with an inscription, a seal, quill-pen,
sealing-wax, and a circular inkstand in two divisions, with an ink-well
in one half and some gold coins in the other.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f45'>

<i>Holbein</i>, p. 101; and in colour in <i>Early German Painters</i>,
folio ii.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The picture has suffered some damage, more particularly in the
colour. The ground, which was originally azure blue, has turned to
a greenish tone, and the shadows of the flesh are now too grey; but the
masterly draughtmanship is still there and the extraordinary insight
into character. Here again the fine and expressive hands at once
attract attention.</p>

<p class='c023'>The letter he holds in his hands is from his father, and is addressed
“Dem ersamen Deryck tybis von Duysburch alwyl London vff wi ...
dgyss mynem lesten Sun....” (“To the honourable Derich Tybis of
Duisburg, at the time in London, in Windgyss, my dear son”). This
address shows that Tybis was living in Windgoose Alley, one of the
passage-ways running through the Steelyard, with the houses and
shops of the members on either side.</p>

<p class='c023'>On the open paper lying on the table is inscribed, in imitation of
the sitter’s handwriting:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c029'>
    <div>“<i>Jesus Christus.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>“Da ick was 33 jar alt was ick Deryck Tybis to London dyser gestalt en hab dyser

<p class='c030'>(“When I was 33 years old, I, Deryck Tybis, in London, had this appearance, and
I have marked this portrait with my device in my own hand, and it was painted by
Holbein in the year 1533, by me Deryck (here stands the device) Tybis von Drys....”)</p>

<p class='c027'>The device, a combination of crosses, is repeated on the seal on
the table, with the letters D.T., reversed, on either side of it. There
is a somewhat similar device on some of the letters in Georg Gisze’s
portrait. The address on the second letter, lying in front of him, is
now almost illegible. There is no inscription on the background.
The writer has found no reference to Tybis in the English State
Papers.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The fourth Steelyard portrait of 1533, that of Cyriacus Fallen, in
the Brunswick Gallery,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c020'><b>[46]</b></a> is also a half-length, about half the size of
life. Like Derich Tybis, the sitter is shown full-face, looking at the
spectator. His hair is cut in the customary Steelyard fashion, and he
is clean-shaven. His black cap is set rather jauntily on one side, and
his black overcoat has a very heavy fur collar, while his fore-sleeves
are of brown silk with a pattern, as in the Wedigh portrait. The neck
of his white embroidered shirt is just visible over the collar. In his
hands he holds his gloves and two letters, superscribed with his name
and address in London. These addresses are not very legible. Dr.
Woltmann at first supposed the Christian name to be Ambrose, but
further examination proved it to be Cyriacus. One of the inscriptions
is: “Dem Ersamen syryacussfalen zu luden vp Stalhoff sy disser
briff”; and the other: “Dem Ersamen f. ... syriakus fallenn in
Lunde ... stalhuff sy dies....”</p>

<p class='c023'>Fallen has a broad face, and a somewhat stolid expression; like
his fellow merchants, he has been placed upon the panel with absolute
truth and precision, without a touch of flattery. The eyes, hands, and
dress are still in excellent condition, but the head, unfortunately, has
suffered greatly in the course of time, and has been much rubbed and
overcleaned, and retouched in numerous places.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c020'><b>[47]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF DERICH BERCK</div>
<p class='c023'>There is a gap of three years before the next and last of this series
of portraits of Hanse merchants is reached, that of Derich Berck or
Berg of Cologne, in Lord Leconfield’s collection at Petworth (#Pl. 5#),<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c020'><b>[48]</b></a>
which is dated 1536. He is represented life-size, at half-length, and full
face, with brown hair and beard, and black dress and cap. Both hands
are shown, and the left, resting on a table with a red cover, holds a
letter addressed:—“Dem Ersame’ v[n]d fromen Derich berk i. London
upt. Stalhoff,” together with the motto <i>besad dz end</i> (“Consider the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>end”), and the trade-mark of his business house. On the table is a
slip of paper with the Latin motto, “Olim meminisse juvabit,” selected
by Berck, says Dr. Ganz, to indicate that Holbein’s brush will secure
him immortality.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c020'><b>[49]</b></a> In the top right-hand corner are the date and the
sitter’s age, “<span class='fss'>AN. 1536. ÆTA: 30</span>” twice over, a later inscription
being painted over the faded original one. The background is blue,
with a green curtain on the left.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r48'>48</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, 241. First published by Dr. Ganz in

</div>

<p class='c023'>The writer has not seen this picture, but it is described as follows
by Dr. Ganz in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>:—“The merchant’s cloth
and cap are black, but not dark; the heavy silk reflects the light in a
greenish colour finely observed. The background is blue, of the same
blue as in the portrait of Richard Southwell at Florence executed in
the same year. It is enriched by a green curtain with red strings,
giving an opportunity for the artist—like the red cloth on the table—for
introducing other tones into his composition, such as black, besides
the main notes of blue and flesh colour. The brightest point in this
profound harmony of colours, a part of the white shirt with black
embroidery, is placed just under the face and makes the fresh and lively
expression of it stronger. The light shines with a rare splendour over
this man’s healthy face and is reflected in the grey-blue eyes, which
look so frank and kindly.” This picture has suffered from over-painting,
but it remains a splendid and virile example of Holbein’s portraiture.
There is a poor copy of it in the Alte Pinakothek at Munich,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c020'><b>[50]</b></a>
purchased in 1899 from a local picture-dealer. It had come originally
from France, and was regarded as an unfinished portrait by Holbein
of an unknown man. The Munich catalogue describes it as a school-replica.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f50'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r50'>50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Reproduced by Ganz, <i>Holbein</i>, p. 219.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>To Holbein the Steelyard proved to be in all ways a fruitful source
of income. Not only was he busily engaged for some years in painting
individual members of the League, but he was also employed by
them in their corporate capacity upon an important work of decoration
for their Guildhall, and in at least one other direction. This
decoration consisted of two large allegorical paintings in tempera
representing “The Triumph of Riches” and “The Triumph of
Poverty.” No record exists as to the date of this work, but it is
reasonable to suppose that the commission was given him in 1532 or
1533, at the time when he was in constant attendance within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>precincts of the Steelyard for the purpose of painting some of its
leading members in the midst of their daily occupations.</p>

<p class='c023'>These decorative paintings have long since disappeared, but the
original design for “The Triumph of Riches” exists, as well as numerous
copies of both compositions, so that it is possible to gain some
idea of their beauty and importance. These allegories, which contained
many life-size figures, were not painted on the walls, but on
canvas, and so easily removable. They added greatly to the artist’s
reputation in this country, and before the close of the sixteenth century
they were celebrated throughout Europe among artists and connoisseurs
of painting. Carel von Mander says that Federigo Zuccaro,
about the year 1574, made two drawings from them, and declared
them to be equal to anything accomplished by Raphael, and that after
his return to Italy he told Goltzius the painter that they were even
finer than any wall-paintings from Raphael’s brush.</p>

<p class='c023'>The two pictures remained in the Guildhall of the Steelyard
until 1598, when it was closed by Queen Elizabeth, who at the same
time expelled the Germans from their houses. For some years the
place remained desolate, and when, in 1606, under James I, the buildings
were restored to the League, most of the property left behind
was found to have been stolen or badly damaged. The glory and
prosperity of the Steelyard, indeed, had completely vanished, never
to be fully restored again, and when the affairs of the Company in
London were finally wound up, the two pictures were presented by
the League, through their representative, the house-master, Holtscho,
on January 22nd, 1616 (old style) to Henry, Prince of Wales, like his
brother, Charles I, a patron of the fine arts. Holtscho, in describing the
event, says: “I cannot, also, leave it unnoticed, that although these
works are old, and have lost their freshness, yet His Highness, as a lover
of painting, and as the works of the master, specially this work, have
been highly commended, has taken great pleasure in them, as I have
myself perceived, and have also heard from himself.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c020'><b>[51]</b></a> The researches
of Dr. Lappenberg have placed these facts beyond doubt, thus disproving
the old legend that the pictures were destroyed when still
hanging on the walls of the banqueting-hall of the Easterlings during
the Great Fire in 1666.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE TWO “TRIUMPHS”</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>It has been generally supposed that on the death of Prince Henry,
two years after they were presented to him, the pictures passed into
the possession of Charles I; and as they were not included among
the pictures of that King’s collection sold by order of the Commonwealth
in 1648-53, Dr. Lappenberg concluded that they must have
remained at Whitehall until destroyed in the fire at that palace in
1698. Further evidence, however, appears to contradict this conclusion.
In Van der Doort’s carefully-prepared catalogue of Charles I’s
collection, although several less important works by Holbein are included,
among them two miniatures, these two celebrated pictures are
not mentioned. Again, Sandrart, in his autobiography, describes the
two compositions in some detail, after seeing them in 1627 in the Earl
of Arundel’s possession, in the long garden gallery in Arundel House.
He does not say whether they were pictures or drawings, so that they
may have been only the original designs; it is much more probable,
however, that they were the large paintings, as Sandrart speaks of
them first of all, as the chief of Holbein’s works belonging to the Earl,
and afterwards describes three of his best known portraits, hanging in
the same gallery, those of Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, and a “Princess
of Lorraine” (the Duchess of Milan), which seems to indicate that
Lord Arundel possessed the large works. It has been suggested that
they may have been presented by Charles I to the Earl; but it is more
likely that they were obtained by exchange with that monarch. Later
on they were taken abroad with the rest of the collection by the Countess
of Arundel, and were in Amsterdam at the time of her death in
1654. In the inventory then drawn up they are merely described as
“Triumpho della Richezza” and “Triumpho della Poverta.” Probably
they were among the pictures hastily sold by Lord Stafford in
that town immediately after his mother’s decease.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c020'><b>[52]</b></a> The last trace
of their history to be found is in a paragraph in Félibien’s <i>Entretiens
sur les Vies et sur les Ouvrages des plus excellents Peintres anciens et
modernes</i>, published in 1666, in which he speaks of them as having
been brought from Flanders to Paris: “Il y avait encore dans la
maison des Ostrelins, dans la salle du Convive, deux tableaux à détrempe,
qu’on a veûs icy depuis quelques années, et qu’on avait envoyez
de Flandres.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c020'><b>[53]</b></a></p>

possession of the Hanseatic League. They were, no doubt, purchased
in Amsterdam by that body, and forwarded to Paris. No further
record of them has been discovered, and as they were already in a
damaged state when presented to the Prince of Wales, the probability
is that they have perished.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE TWO “TRIUMPHS”</div>
<p class='c023'>Holbein’s original sketch for “The Triumph of Riches,” a masterly
pen drawing washed with Indian-ink, and touched with white in the
high lights, is in the Louvre (#Pl. 6#).<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c020'><b>[54]</b></a> A similar drawing in the British
Museum, purchased in 1854, which at one time was attributed to
Holbein himself, is said by Woltmann to be a tracing of the Louvre
example; but it has no appearance of being traced, and is certainly
a copy, perhaps by an Italian.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c020'><b>[55]</b></a> The heads and attributes are given
a Raphaelesque air, strikingly different from the Flemish style of a
second drawing in the Museum, of the second composition, “The
Triumph of Poverty.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c020'><b>[56]</b></a> This latter is in black and red chalks and
pen, washed with Indian-ink, and heightened with white, on a blue
background, and was acquired in 1894 from the Eastlake collection.
Lady Eastlake possessed a similar drawing of the “Riches.” Both
are in all probability by Lucas Vorsterman the younger, and were
purchased by Sir Charles Eastlake from the Walpole sale in 1842 for
sixteen guineas. They appear to be copies, as Vertue suggested, made
for engraving purposes by Lucas Vorsterman from the drawings done
by Zuccaro in 1574; or possibly from the original paintings when in
Amsterdam. Vorsterman certainly engraved one, if not both subjects,
though only his engraving of the “Poverty” is known. These
drawings,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c020'><b>[57]</b></a> at one time in the Lely collection, were in Buckingham
House, before it was purchased for a royal palace, and were sold as
allegorical works by Van Dyck, and bought by Horace Walpole, who
regarded the “Riches” as by Vorsterman, and the “Poverty” as by
Zuccaro; but the latter, like the former, is decidedly Flemish in style.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c020'><b>[58]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Sandrart possessed copies, in all probability those made by Zuccaro,
which were afterwards in the Crozat collection, and when that collection
was sold passed into that of Privy Councillor Fleischmann, of
Strasburg, and while in his possession were engraved for Von Mechel’s
“œuvres de Jean Holbein,” and inscribed “Zuccari delin. 1574.”
All further traces of these Zuccaro drawings have now been lost.</p>

<p class='c023'>The British Museum possesses a very rare and interesting
engraving, dated 1561,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c020'><b>[59]</b></a> and inscribed “Faicte par Maistre Hans
Holbeyn tres excellent pointre. Et imprime par Johan Borg<b>ni</b> Floret<b>o</b>
en Anuers lan <span class='fss'>M·D·LXI</span>.” It is evidently taken from Holbein’s
original design, which must have been in Antwerp at that date. Larger
copies of both paintings are also in the British Museum; they are by
Jan de Bisschop, a Dutch artist who died in 1686, and were probably
made from the original large compositions when they were in Amsterdam.
They are pen drawings washed with bistre, and are executed
with great detail (#Pl. 7#).<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c020'><b>[60]</b></a> The “Riches” shows several minor
differences and some additions when compared with the Louvre
drawing. Two new characters are introduced, <i>Phileas</i> and <i>Leo Pisanus</i>,
their heads appearing before and behind the charioteer, as well as
<i>Heliogabalus</i> and some unnamed persons; there is a parrot on the tree
in the background (as in the Vorsterman drawing), while the tree itself
is much larger and more finished. All goes to prove, in short, that the
Louvre drawing and the copy of it in the British Museum represent
Holbein’s study for the painting, while the Bisschop drawings were
made from the paintings themselves, and the Vorsterman drawings
either from the finished works or from Zuccaro’s copies of them, and
represent the final designs.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c020'><b>[61]</b></a> The British Museum possesses a third
copy of the “Triumph of Poverty,” made by Matthäus Merian the
Younger in 1640, when the picture was still in London.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c020'><b>[62]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>It has been noted in an earlier chapter that Holbein, in his wall-paintings,
was influenced by the example of Andrea Mantegna, whose
“Triumph of Cæsar” had a European reputation. The Steelyard
allegories were compositions of a similar nature, though in no sense
copies of any earlier Italian work. The “Triumph of Riches” represents
a crowded procession moving towards the spectator’s left. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>magnificent chariot of Plutus, drawn by four white horses, is followed
and surrounded by the most famous men of wealth of antiquity. The
god of riches himself, old, bent, and bald, is seated on a high seat at
the back of the car, with his feet on a sack of gold. In front of him
sits Fortune on a globe, blindfolded,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c020'><b>[63]</b></a> her veil blown out like a sail,
and stooping down to scatter gold among the crowd; and in front of
her sits the Charioteer, named <i>Ratio</i>, holding the reins, which are
labelled <i>Notitia</i> and <i>Voluntas</i>. The two near horses,
<i>Impostura</i> and <i>Contractus</i>, are led by <i>Bona Fides</i>
and <i>Justitia</i>, two finely designed figures of women, while two
other women, <i>Liberalitas</i> and <i>Æqualitas</i>,
are mounted on the off horses, <i>Avaritia</i> and <i>Usura</i>, which they urge
along with short whips. On either side of the chariot walk Simonides,
Sichaeus, Leo Byzantius, Bassa, Themistocles, Pythius, Crispinus,
Ventidius, who holds up his toga to catch the coins Fortune is scattering,
Gadareus and others, some of them bent down with the weight of
gold they are carrying in sacks or large purses. Behind the car rides
Crœsus, a majestic, crowned figure, his horse led by Narcissus, with
Cleopatra, Midas, Tantalus, and other riders bringing up the rear.
On the extreme right of the composition <i>Nemesis</i> hovers over them in
the clouds. To each figure a label with the name is attached, all of
which are not given on the Louvre drawing, but are found in the
Vorsterman and Bisschop copies. On the extreme left, in the sky, is a
large cartellino,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c020'><b>[64]</b></a> with a Latin inscription of two lines in Roman
characters:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE “TRIUMPH OF POVERTY”</div>
<p class='c023'>Both compositions were of the same height, but the “Triumph of
Riches” was much the longer of the two, so that they must have been
painted to fill particular and prescribed wall-spaces in the Hall. Probably
the “Riches” occupied the place of honour on one of the long
walls, opposite the windows, with the “Poverty” at one of the ends
of the room. The latter, according to Dr. Ganz, came first, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>heads of a number of the figures in the foreground are turned
backwards as though looking across the room at the other procession
following them. In the “Triumph of Poverty,” in which the procession
moves in the same direction, from right to left, the central figure is
Poverty, an old woman, lean, and bare to the waist, seated in a rough
waggon with upright poles bearing a canopy of straw. Over her head is
a label with the Greek title “Πενια.” Behind her sits
<i>Infortunium</i>, striking with a rod at the heads of the crowd of
poverty-stricken, half-naked figures following the cart, among whom
are an old man, <i>Mendicitas</i>, and an old woman, <i>Miseria</i>.
In front of Poverty sits <i>Industria</i>, distributing instruments of
labour, hammers, chisels, flails, squares, and other tools to the poor
workmen walking below, and she is supported by <i>Usus</i> and
<i>Memoria</i>. The cart is driven by <i>Spes</i>, who looks up
towards heaven, and is drawn by two oxen, <i>Negligentia</i> and
<i>Pigritia</i>, in the shafts, and two asses, <i>Stupiditas</i> and
<i>Ignavia</i>, as leaders. These steeds are led by four finely
designed female figures, <i>Moderatio</i>, with a whip,
<i>Diligentia</i>, <i>Solicitudo</i>, and <i>Labor</i>, the last
carrying a heavy spade. Behind <i>Labor</i> walks a young man with a
basket of carpenter’s tools, and a flail over his shoulder. On a tree
in the left background hangs a large wooden tablet with a long Latin
inscription, also attributed to Sir Thomas More, beginning:</p>

<p class='c023'>From the Louvre sketch in particular, but also from the numerous
more or less faithful copies, sufficient evidence of the fine decorative
character of the originals, their sense of rhythmic movement, their
creative power and imagination, and the nobility of their design, can be
obtained. The allegories they set forth were plain enough to read.
They pointed out the instability of fortune and glory, and the virtue
to be found in honest poverty, and warned the merchants who daily
looked upon them, and whose avocations were the making of money,
against undue arrogance in prosperity or needless despondency in
adversity. “Both pieces,” says Van Mander, who describes them
with some care, “were excellently arranged, freely drawn, and well
delineated.” The colour-scheme appears to have matched the fine
decorative qualities of the design. The compositions were not carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>out in natural colours as in a picture. They were painted in greyish
monochrome, with colour sparingly used. The background was blue,
green was used in the trees, and the horses which drew the chariot of
Plutus were white. The flesh tints of the numerous figures were
rendered naturally, but the garments they wore were in monochrome,
ornamented at the borders with gold, which was also used in other
parts of the canvas with excellent effect, so that the paintings, when
in position on the walls, must have added to the rich and brilliant
appearance of the room, with its sideboards covered with silver plate
and pewter ware.</p>

<p class='c023'>We have one other record of a commission given to Holbein by the
Steelyard. This was the design for the triumphal arch which they
erected on Saturday, May 31st, 1533, when Anne Boleyn rode in procession
from the Tower through the City to Westminster for her coronation.
From a letter written by Chapuys, the Imperial Ambassador
in London, to Charles V, dated May 18th in that year, it is evident that
the Germans were not anxious to incur the cost of this decoration;
but the Londoners, who had contributed 5000 ducats towards the
festivities, of which 3000 were for a present to the new Queen, were
determined to make all the inhabitants, irrespective of nationality,
pay their due share.</p>

<p class='c023'>“The Easterlings,” says Chapuys, “as being subjects of your
Majesty, would like to be excused, but the great privileges they enjoy
here prevent them from objecting.”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c020'><b>[66]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>“APOLLO AND THE MUSES”</div>
<p class='c023'>Having determined to do it, however, they did it well, as contemporary
records bear witness. Stow tells us that Anne, after
being greeted at Fenchurch Street by the children of the City Schools,
was still more splendidly welcomed at the corner of Gracechurch
Street, “where was a costly and marvellous cunning pageant made by
the merchants of the Stilyard: therein was the Mount Parnassus,
with the Fountaine of Helicon, which was of white marble, and four
streames without pipe did rise an ell high, and mette together in a little
cup above the fountaine, which fountaine ranne abundantly with
Reynish wine till night. On the mountaine sat <i>Apollo</i>, and at his feete
sate <i>Caliope</i>; and on every side of the mountaine sate four Muses,
playing on severell sweet instruments, and all their jestes, epigrams,
and poesies were wrytten in golden letters, in the which every Muse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>according to her property, praysed the Queene.” Camusat, in his
narrative, says: “In all open places were scaffolds, on which mysteries
were played; and fountains poured forth wine. Along the streets all
the merchants were stationed.”</p>

<p class='c023'>This triumphal arch was designed by Holbein. His original sketch
for it, formerly in the Crozat collection, and more recently in that of the
late Herr Rudolph Weigel, of Leipzig, is now in the Berlin Print Room
(#Pl. 8#).<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c020'><b>[67]</b></a> In its details it corresponds almost exactly with Stow’s
description. In the centre Apollo is seated on a rock, beneath a slight
bower or baldachin consisting of thin pillars supporting slender arches
wreathed with leaves, across which hangs a scroll-shaped tablet for
an inscription, the whole surmounted by a two-headed Imperial eagle.
Apollo holds a small harp on his left knee, and with his right hand
directs the music of the attendant Muses, who are grouped beneath
him, five on the left hand and four on the right, on either side of a
fountain of fine Renaissance design, in which the wine is falling from
the smaller upper basin into the larger one beneath. The two front
figures, Calliope and Polyhymnia, are seated, with lute and viol. Four
of the others are singing, and the remainder playing various musical
instruments, one with both a trumpet and a small drum. Apollo,
crowned with a wreath, is clad in classical costume, but the ladies are
wearing dresses of Holbein’s day. On either side of the group rise
two tall candelabra, with blank shields for coats of arms, surmounted
with royal crowns. In the background rocky mountains are indicated.
The whole composition is supported by a central arch, of rich Renaissance
design, shown in perspective, with a large blank tablet, to
contain words of welcome, at its crown, and there are indications of
smaller arches on either side. Thus it is evident that the decoration
was not a painted one, but was a solid structure built across the street,
under which the royal carriage would pass, and that Apollo and the
Muses were represented by living persons, who played their instruments
as the procession went by, while the white marble fountain splashed
its Rhenish wine.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The sketch is a very hasty one, but would be quite sufficient to
indicate to the Steelyard the artist’s intentions. Holbein himself, no
doubt, superintended the erection of the archway. Slight as it is, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>is masterly in draughtsmanship, displaying Holbein’s delicacy and
certainty of touch in every stroke. The two seated figures, more
particularly the one on the right, are rapidly drawn with the greatest
grace and charm. According to Woltmann the Imperial eagle on the
summit has only one head; the drawing is rubbed at the top, but there
seem to be indications that the split or two-headed bird, which was
then customary, was intended. Mr. W. F. Dickes denies that this
drawing was intended for the Steelyard arch; he considers it to be a
sketch for one of the Apollo musical festivals of Holbein’s Guild
“zum Himmel” at Basel, and uses it as a proof that the painter had
returned to his adopted city in 1533.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c020'><b>[68]</b></a> He bases this on an entry in
the Banner Book of the Guild, dated November 23rd, 1533, which he
reads as a payment to Holbein for banners painted for some festivity.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c020'><b>[69]</b></a>
The symbol of the Basel Painters’ Guild was a pigeon with outstretched
wings, within a wreath or bower, and Mr. Dickes sees in the eagle of
the Berlin drawing, which is not within a bower, the pigeon of the
Guild. He states, too, that as the Hanseatic League included merchants
of other than German nationality they would have been unwilling to
use an emblem so limiting as the Imperial bird. This statement is,
however, incorrect. No doubt exists as to the use of the eagle on this
particular occasion. It was, indeed, viewed with extreme distaste
by the new Queen. Eustace Chapuys, writing to Charles V on July
11th, less than six weeks after the event, says: “I understand the
lady (<i>i.e.</i>, Anne) complains daily of the Easterlings, who on the day of
her entry had set the Imperial eagle predominant over the King’s
arms and hers.... This may serve as an indication of her perverse
and malicious nature.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c020'><b>[70]</b></a> And again, on the 30th of the same month,
he returns to the same subject: “... the Lady who, as I am told,
was not at all pleased with the Easterlings and other Germans for
bringing me to see their fleet, which is greater than any that has been
seen here for a long time; or that, at a solemn banquet which they
made, the ships did march with their artillery. She is in a still worse
humour because this was done near Greenwich park; and this has
renewed the regret she felt for the eagle which the Easterlings carried
in triumph the day of her entry here.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c020'><b>[71]</b></a> These letters afford additional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>evidence that Holbein made this drawing for the occasion of Anne’s
coronation, and that it has nothing to do with Basel or the Zunft zum
Himmel.</p>

<p class='c023'>The Imperial two-headed eagle was also carved in stone over the
principal entrance to the Steelyard. The old device had disappeared
in the course of time, but in 1670 a new one was placed in position.
The following item occurs in a series of accounts still extant in connection
with the Steelyard buildings of that period: “December 31st,
1670. To Gabriel Cibbert, stone-cutter,—for the eagle put on over
the gate from Thames Street, fixed on John Balls buildings, £5.”
Caius Gabriel Cibber, a native of Holstein, and father of Colley Cibber,
was a sculptor of some merit who practised in London. This sculptured
shield-shaped stone, bearing an eagle displayed with a crowned
collar and two heads, surrounded by an inscription, was also removed
in course of time, and was recently found by Mr. Lawrence Weaver in
the garden of Bickley Hall, Kent.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c020'><b>[72]</b></a></p>

THROUGHOUT the earlier years of Holbein’s second
sojourn in England, though he was busily occupied on
work for the German merchants of the Steelyard, his
time was by no means completely taken up with the
commissions they gave him both individually and as
a corporate body. During the same period he painted
the portraits of more than one Englishman and several foreigners of
distinction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>LETTER OF RECALL FROM BASEL</div>
<p class='c023'>As already pointed out, he probably returned to England during
the first months of 1532. It is to be presumed that he arrived thus
early—or even in the late autumn of the previous year—or otherwise
it is difficult to account for the letter of recall, dated 2nd September
1532, which was sent to him in England by the Burgomaster of Basel,
Jakob Meyer—not his old patron, Meyer zum Hasen, but Jakob Meyer
zum Hirschen—on behalf of the Council. Such a letter would hardly
have been written if he had been absent from Basel for only a month
or two. It is probable that the best part of a year would be allowed
to elapse before a recall was sent to him. It runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c023'>“Master Hans Holbein, the painter, now in England.</p>

<p class='c023'>“We, Jacob Meiger, Burgomaster, and the Council of the City of
Basel, send greeting to our dear citizen, Hans Holbein, and let you
herewith know that it would please us if you would repair home as
soon as possible. In that case, in order that you may the better stay
at home and support your wife and children, we will furnish you yearly
with thirty pieces of money, until we are able to take care of you better.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>We have wished to inform you of this, in order that you may conform
to our desire. Dated Monday, 2nd September 1532.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c020'><b>[73]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f73'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r73'>73</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, English translation, p. 336. Original text in
Woltmann, i. 363, and Wornum, p. 265.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The offer contained in this letter, which, though its terms were
not lavish, was a proof that his fellow-citizens appreciated his art and
were anxious to induce him to reside permanently in Basel, was not
tempting enough to induce Holbein to leave England. Whatever
his answer may have been—for it is to be presumed that he received
the letter, though there is no actual evidence to show that he did so—the
Council’s request proved ineffectual. He must have felt that it
would be folly to abandon regular and remunerative employment in
London for doubtful and ill-paid municipal commissions in Switzerland,
more particularly as he had so recently formed a new and lucrative
connection with the Steelyard, while memories of the bad times
lately encountered in Basel were still vivid.</p>

<p class='c023'>As already pointed out, the only three portraits by him bearing
the date 1532 are of German merchants. In the following year, however,
more than one fine work affords proof that the Steelyard was by
no means his only source of income. His most important undertaking
in 1533 was the large double portrait generally known as “The Two
Ambassadors,” now in the National Gallery, for which it was purchased,
in 1890, with two other pictures, from the fifth Earl of Radnor, for
£55,000, of which £25,000 was contributed by the State, and £30,000
by Messrs. Nathaniel Rothschild &amp; Sons, Lord Iveagh, and Mr. Charles
Cotes. The addition of this great painting to the national collections,
in which, until then, Holbein had been unrepresented, aroused much
curiosity as to the personality of the two sitters. Many attempts
were made to identify them, and numerous solutions of the riddle
were suggested in letters to the <i>Times</i> and other papers and reviews.
Magazine articles were written about it, and, lastly, two volumes of
considerable size were published with this picture as their sole subject.
Probably no other painting in the world has produced so great
a mass of literature.</p>

<p class='c023'>“The scene is a chamber paved with inlaid marbles, and hung
with green damask, which in the upper left-hand corner partly reveals
a silver crucifix attached to the wall behind. In the centre of the
composition is a wooden stand, having an upper and a lower shelf. To
the left of this, leaning his arm upon it, stands Jean de Dinteville, a
young man with dark-brown eyes and beard, in a rich costume of the
period of Henry VIII, wearing a heavy gold chain with the badge of
the French order of Saint-Michel, and, on his right side, depending
from his girdle, a dagger with wrought gold hilt and sheath: on the
sheath the inscription—<span class='fss'>ÆT. SVÆ 29.</span> in relief. In his black bonnet
is a jewel formed of a silver skull set in gold. To the right, George
de Selve, dark-eyed, with a close beard, also leans upon the stand, or,
more immediately, on a clasped book, the edges of which are inscribed:
<span class='fss'>ÆTATIS SVÆ 25.</span> He wears a four-cornered black cap, and a loose,
long-sleeved gown of mulberry and black brocade, lined with sable,
and reaching to the ground. Both these persons regard the spectator.
The upper shelf of the stand is covered with a Turkish rug, on which
are several mathematical and astronomical instruments, and, close to
the principal personage, a celestial globe. The lower shelf bears a
case of flutes, a lute, an open music-book containing part of the score
and words of the Lutheran hymn, ‘Komm, heiliger Geist,’ a smaller
book, on arithmetic, kept partly open by a small square, a pair of
compasses, and a terrestrial hand-globe, which is in a direct line below
the other globe. Under the stand lies the lute-case. Conspicuous
in the foreground is the <i>anamorphosis</i>, or perspectively distorted
image, of a human skull, which, touching the floor on the left, stretches
obliquely upwards towards the right. In the shadow cast on the
floor by the chief personage is the inscription—‘<span class='fss'>JOANNES HOLBEIN
PINGEBAT 1533</span>’ in sloping Roman letters.” To this it should be
added that Dinteville’s dress consists of a slashed doublet of rose-coloured
satin, and a black surcoat. The latter is lined with ermine,
with which the shoulder-puffs, further adorned with gold tags, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>piped. A large gold and green silk tassel, of very fine execution, hangs,
with the dagger, from his girdle, and he also wears a sword, only the
hilt and sheathed point of which are seen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HISTORY OF THE PICTURE</div>
<p class='c023'>All that was known about the picture at the time of its purchase
for the National Gallery was that at the end of the eighteenth century
it was in the possession of Jean Batiste Pierre Le Brun, the Parisian
picture-dealer, and husband of the well-known portrait-painter,
Madame Vigée Le Brun. Le Brun issued a very indifferent engraving
of it by J. A. Pierron in Part XII (dated 1790) of his “Galerie des
Peintres Flamands, Hollandais et Allemands.” In the index it was
described as representing “MM. de Selve et d’Avaux; l’un, Ambassadeur
à Venise, l’autre, dans les pays du Nord, avec les attributs des
Arts qu’ils cultivaient; on voit à terre une Tête de Mort en perspective,
à prendre de l’angle gauche, qui de face ressemble à un poisson.”
When the publication was issued in volume form in 1792, with text,
Le Brun slightly amplified this note, and added “J’ai depuis vendu
ce tableau pour l’Angleterre, où il est maintenant; les figures sont de
grandeur naturelle.” He gives no information as to the source from
which he obtained the picture. It is stated in the National Gallery
catalogue that it is probable that it came into the hands of the dealer
Vandergucht, and that from him it was purchased by the second Earl
of Radnor, about 1790 or 1795; but from the account books of Longford
Castle it would appear that it was sold to the Earl by the dealer
Buchanan, who received one thousand guineas for it, the payments
being made in 1808 and 1809.</p>

<p class='c023'>During the years the picture remained in Longford Castle many
guesses were made as to the identity of the personages. Le Brun’s
title, which, after all, contained half the truth, was not accepted by
the leading critics, largely owing, no doubt, to the fact that the title
of Avaux did not exist until more than a hundred years after the
picture was painted, so that, the one name being impossible, the other
was included in the same category. In the end, a suggestion that
the man on the left of the picture was Sir Thomas Wyat was regarded
as a very possible solution. Mr. Wornum, in his book published in
1867, gave this attribution a qualified acceptance—“the subject is
doubtful, but it is supposed to represent Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet
and diplomatist, and some learned friend”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c020'><b>[75]</b></a>—and Dr. Woltmann
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>followed suit, but went a step further, suggesting John Leland, the
antiquary, as the second figure.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c020'><b>[76]</b></a> Both identifications, however, were
shown to be inaccurate by Mr. J. Gough Nichols in a paper contributed
to <i>Archæologia</i> in 1873;<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c020'><b>[77]</b></a> but he could offer no name in substitution,
and so the matter stood until the purchase of the picture for the
nation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE IDENTITY OF THE SITTERS</div>
<p class='c023'>The public exhibition of this splendid example of Holbein’s art
produced a long and interesting correspondence in the <i>Times</i> newspaper.
Sir J. C. Robinson upheld Dr. Woltmann’s belief that the two
men were Wyat and Leland, but Sir Sidney Colvin,<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c020'><b>[78]</b></a> by means of convincing
proofs, showed that this attribution was untenable, as also
that of Le Brun. He gave, at the same time, four reasons for supposing
that the personage on the left was really a Frenchman and an
ambassador—(1) the traditional title; (2) its having been sold into this
country from France; (3) the wearing of the French order of Saint-Michel;
and (4) the close resemblance in dress and fashion of the personage
in question and the portrait of another French Ambassador,
the “Morette” at Dresden. He proposed, as a probable solution, the
name of Jean de Dinteville—a suggestion which afterwards proved
to be the correct one. When, in August 1891, the picture was cleaned,
and the name of Polisy, Dinteville’s birthplace, an obscure village in
Burgundy, was discovered on the terrestrial globe, the only other
French towns upon it being Paris, Lyon and Bayonne, the identity
of the left-hand figure was placed almost beyond doubt. Sir Sidney
also suggested that the second person might be Nicolas Bourbon, the
French poet.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f78'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r78'>78</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>The Times</i>, September 1890.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Other attempted identifications included such divers personages
as Lord Rochford, brother of Anne Boleyn; Count Balthazar Castiglione,
who came to England to receive the Order of the Garter for the
Duke of Urbino; and Guillaume and Jean du Bellay. The last-named
solution was published in a pamphlet in 1890 by Mr. Elias Dexter,
under the title of <i>Holbein’s Ambassadors Identified</i>. The writer sought
to prove that the National Gallery picture and the one engraved for
Le Brun were not the same, and that there must be two versions of
the subject in existence. This contention he based on a number of
slight differences between the accessories in the picture and in Pierron’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>print, but such differences may be easily explained by the inferiority
of the engraver’s work and the unusual complexity of the many
details. To prove the identity of the two sitters with the brothers Du
Bellay, who in 1533 were about 42 and 41 years of age respectively,
he was obliged to declare the inscriptions on the dagger and the book
to be forgeries. It is true that Jean du Bellay was in England in that
year for a short time, and this is Mr. Dexter’s sole evidence, though
he professes to see a strong likeness between the two ambassadors and
the portraits of the brothers Du Bellay engraved on the same plate
in the ninth volume of the <i>Versailles Gallery</i>.</p>

<p class='c023'>A much more elaborate theory was advanced by Mr. W. F. Dickes
in three articles in the <i>Magazine of Art</i>, and in several letters to the
<i>Times</i> in answer to critics unfriendly to his attempted solution of the
riddle. His contention is that the picture was painted as a memorial
of the Treaty of Nuremberg between the Catholics and Protestants
in 1532, and that the two persons represented are the brothers Otto
Henry and Philipp of Neuburg, Counts Palatine of the Rhine. This
theory he still further elaborated in a book published in 1903 under
the title of <i>Holbein’s Ambassadors Unriddled</i>. His arguments, however,
are singularly unconvincing, and have failed to obtain the support
of any serious student of Holbein. Before dealing with them,
however, it will be better to give a brief account of the discoveries of
Miss Mary F. S. Hervey, by means of which the identity of Holbein’s
two sitters was finally set at rest. Her account of her discovery of a
document which provided conclusive evidence that the two Ambassadors
were Jean de Dinteville and George de Selve was communicated
to the <i>Times</i>,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c020'><b>[79]</b></a> and this, together with further corroborative evidence,
was embodied in a book, <i>Holbein’s Ambassadors: the Picture and the
Men</i>, published in 1900.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f79'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r79'>79</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>The Times</i>, December 7, 1895.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In 1895 Miss Hervey happened to come across a copy of the <i>Revue
de Champagne et de Brie</i> for 1888, which gave a short notice of a picture
formerly preserved at Polisy, containing the portraits of Jean de
Dinteville and George de Selve. This paragraph was based on a catalogue
published in March 1888 by M. Saffroy, an antiquarian bookseller
of Pré-Saint-Gervais, in which a seventeenth-century parchment,
describing the picture, was offered for sale. Miss Hervey hastened
to communicate with M. Saffroy, and by one of those happy chances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>which seldom occur, the document was still in his possession, and
proved to contain exactly the information which had so long been
sought in vain. The following is a translation of its complete text
as given by Miss Hervey:—</p>

<p class='c023'>“[Remarks on the subject of an excellent picture of the Sieurs
d’Inteville Polizy, and George de Selve Bishop of Lavour, showing the
offices they held, and the time of their decease.]</p>

<p class='c023'>“In this picture is represented, life-size, Messire Jean de DIntevile
chevalier Sieur de Polizy, near Bar-sur-Seyne, Bailly of Troyes, who
was Ambassador in England for King Francis I in the years 1532 [O.S.]
and 1533 and since Gouverneur of Monsieur Charles de France, second
son (<i>sic</i>) of the said King; the said Charles died at Forest Monstier in the
year 1545, and the said Sr. de DIntvile in the year 1555. Interred in the
Church of the said Polizy. There is also represented in the said picture
Messire George de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur, a personage of great learning
and virtue, who was Ambassador with the Emperor Charles V;
the said Bishop was the son of Messire Jean de Selve, Premier President
of the Parliament of Paris; the said Bishop died in 1541, having in
the above-mentioned year 1532, or 1533, gone to England by permission
of the King, to visit the said Sieur de DIntevile, his intimate
friend, and also of all his family; and they two having met in England
an excellent Dutch painter, employed him to make this picture, which
has been carefully preserved at the same place, Polizy, up to the
year 1653.”</p>

<p class='c023'>The manuscript consists of an oblong piece of parchment which
may have been cut from an inventory, but it is more probable that it
was written as a descriptive label to be attached to the picture-frame,
after the picture’s removal from Polisy in 1653. The latter supposition
would account for the fact that no mention is made of the place
where the picture then was, which would, of course, be unnecessary.
The authenticity of this document has been pronounced by the
British Museum authorities to be indisputable. The body of it was
written just after the middle of the seventeenth century, while the
heading was added at a slightly later date, at a time, no doubt, when
the label had become separated from the picture.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE PICTURE AT POLISY</div>
<p class='c023'>In her book Miss Hervey gives a long and interesting account of
the lives of the two men. It is sufficient to state here that Jean de
Dinteville was born in September 1504, and was therefore in his twenty-ninth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>year when he came to England as resident French ambassador
in February 1533; and that the name “Polisy” is given a prominent
place on the terrestrial globe placed near him in the picture. The
second sitter, George de Selve, was appointed to the see of Lavaur in
1526, when he was in his eighteenth year, but was only consecrated
in 1534, when he was in his twenty-sixth year, which exactly agrees
with the inscription on the picture, which states that he was then in
his twenty-fifth year.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c020'><b>[80]</b></a> Further evidence exists in the shape of a grant
from the Pope to De Selve, dated May 1526, permitting him to hold
several benefices “although only seventeen years old.” The fact
that he was not consecrated until the year after the picture was painted,
although appointed to the see of Lavaur in 1526, explains why Holbein
has not represented him in episcopal robes.</p>

Selve. (Quoted by Miss Hervey, p. 13.)</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>This document is confirmed by a further discovery by Miss Hervey
of a <i>Mémoire</i> preserved in the Bibliothèque de l’Institut at Paris,
which gives a summary of three letters concerning the picture. The
letters themselves, which so far, with possibly one exception, have not
yet been discovered, were addressed by Nicolas Camusat, the antiquary,
canon of Troyes, and an intimate friend of the Dinteville
family for many years, to his friends the Godefroy brothers, to
whom and to others he constantly supplied antiquarian and genealogical
information. His letters relating to Polisy extended from
1607 to 1655.</p>

<p class='c023'>The following is a translation of the memorandum:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Memoir in explanation of three letters sent by Monsr. Camusat,
Canon of St. Pierre at Troyes, [touching a picture made in England
of George de Selve, Bp. of Lavaur, who had gone thither to visit the
Bailly of Troies, Sr. de Polizi, Jean d’Inteville, at that time the King’s
ambassador].</p>

<p class='c030'>“There are two relating to the Bishop of Lavaur, George de Selve,
son of Mr. le Premier President de Selve, which Bishop had been invited
by Mr. de Polizy, bailly of Troyes, ambassador in England in the
years 1532 [O.S.] and 1533, to visit him in England, which he did,
having first taken leave of the King. And being in England, they had
made the excellent picture by a Dutch painter, Holben, which picture
was preserved in the House of Polizy, distant but one league from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Bar-sur-Seine, a hundred and forty [<i>sic</i>] years and more, as belonging
to the Seigneur of the place, Sr. de Sessac, until the year 1653, when he
had it removed to Paris, to his house near the parish of St. Sulpice;
the said picture representing the said Sr. de Polizy, Jean de d’Inteville,
and the said Sr. Bishop of Lavaur, who was afterwards ambassador
with Charles V; and the said Bishop died in 1541. The said picture
is considered the finest piece of painting in France in the opinion of
the best painters. M. le Mareschal du Plessis-Praslain not long since
bought the estate of Polisy for three hundred thousand livres from
the said Sr. de Sessac.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Mr. de Vic, garde des sceaux, formerly said that it was the most
beautiful piece of painting in France.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Mr. George de Selve, and his brothers, worthily served France in
various embassies and legations.”</p>

<p class='c027'>In this document the name of the painter, “Holben,” is given;
it is inserted between the lines, but is in the same hand and of the same
date as the writing which surrounds it. The portion at the head of
the memorandum between brackets is by another hand. It is interesting
to note that not only is the name of the painter given but that in
the seventeenth century Holbein’s work was considered, both by
painters and amateurs, to be the finest picture then in France. There
is in the Godefroy collection a second paper, a copy, dated 1654, of a
memorandum drawn up by Camusat, in which there is further reference
to the picture. It need not be quoted here, but it speaks of the figures
as life-size, and concludes by saying that “the piece is esteemed the
richest and best wrought that is to be found in France.”<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c020'><b>[81]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f81'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r81'>81</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Miss Hervey, <i>Holbein’s Ambassadors</i>, p. 18
<i>et seq.</i>, where both documents are reproduced in facsimile.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Thus the identity of Holbein’s sitters is irrefutably established,
and the picture’s history can now be traced almost without a break.
Dinteville, who had already been in England on a short mission in 1531,
reached London at the beginning of February 1533, and was lodged
in the royal palace of Bridewell, by the Thames. The exact date of
George de Selve’s visit to him is not known, but it was between February
and Easter in that year; he was back in France before the end of
May. There appears to have been some secrecy in connection with the
latter’s journey to England, for though he had the permission of Francis
I, for some reason Montmorency, the Grand Master, was, if possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to be kept in ignorance of it. In a letter, dated 23rd May, to his
brother, the Bishop of Auxerre, Dinteville says: “Monsr. de Lavor
m’a fait cest honneur que de me venir veoir, qui ne m’a esté petit
plaisir. Il n’est point de besoing que Mr. le grant maistre en entende
rien.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c020'><b>[82]</b></a></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r82'>82</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From a letter in the Dupuy Collection, Paris, Bibl. Nat.,
vol. 726, f. 46, quoted by Miss Hervey, p. 80.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>JEAN DE DINTEVILLE AND HOLBEIN</div>
<p class='c023'>It is impossible to say in what way Dinteville became acquainted
with Holbein, or to whose offices the introduction between ambassador
and painter was due. Dinteville counted among his friends more than
one of Holbein’s sitters, while he was, no doubt, well acquainted with
Niklaus Kratzer through his keen interest in mechanics and the various
astronomical and mathematical sciences. He had thus more than
one opportunity of seeing examples of Holbein’s skill in portraiture,
and it is to be gathered that he conceived a great admiration for it, for
otherwise he would not have ordered so large and important a portrait
group of himself and his friend. With the exception of the “Duchess
of Milan,” the More family group, and the now lost “Fitzwilliam,
Earl of Southampton,” of which there is a good copy in the Fitzwilliam
Museum, Cambridge, the “Ambassadors” is the only portrait-panel
painted by Holbein in England of which there is any record in
which the figures are shown both life-size and at full-length. As there
is no reference in the State papers of England or France to the semi-secret
business which brought George de Selve over to London, the
suggestion may be hazarded that he came for the express purpose of
having his portrait painted, Dinteville urging him to do so on account
of the excellent painter he had discovered. The picture, crowded as
it is with intricate accessories, must have taken a considerable time to
complete. It was, no doubt, painted in the Ambassador’s own room
in Bridewell Palace, and the sitter and the painter must have spent
long hours in planning out and arranging the many mathematical and
scientific instruments which form so important a feature of the panel,
some of which may have been lent by or purchased from Kratzer.
The visit of the future Bishop of Lavaur was so short that he can
hardly have seen more than the beginning of the work and the finishing
of his own head and hands. No doubt Holbein followed his usual
practice and made preliminary studies of the two heads, but these
drawings have not been traced, although there is a very fine unnamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>study in the Windsor collection (<a href='#pl-36a'>Pl. 36 (1)</a>)<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c020'><b>[83]</b></a> which is supposed to
represent Jean de Dinteville, the features showing sufficient resemblance
to those of the Bailly of Troyes to induce the suggestion that it represents
him at a later date. Both Sir Sidney Colvin and Miss Hervey hold this
opinion, as did the late Sir Frederick Burton; but it must be confessed
that the resemblance is not very striking.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c020'><b>[84]</b></a> The Windsor drawing is
of a man considerably older than the Dinteville of the picture; but
the Bailly, after his residence in this country throughout the greater
part of 1533, paid only three short visits to London between the years
1535 and 1537. Even if the drawing had been made by Holbein in the
last-named year he would only have been in his thirty-third year. A
miniature or portrait, painted by Holbein from this drawing, was in
the Arundel Collection, and was engraved by Hollar. It is highly
improbable, too, that after he had been so elaborately painted
Dinteville would have sat again for his portrait a few years later, so
that, all things considered, this attribution can only be accepted with
caution. There is, however, an undoubted portrait of Dinteville at
Chantilly, forming part of the collection of drawings of the ladies and
gentlemen of the Court of Francis I, by Jean Clouet and his school,
which was formerly at Castle Howard. This portrait was identified
by Miss Hervey in 1904.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c020'><b>[85]</b></a> The likeness is very marked, though the
drawing lacks the strength and fine draughtsmanship to be found in
similar portrait-studies by Holbein, and it appears to have been done
within a few years of the picture itself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“THE COURT OF FRANCIS II”</div>
<p class='c023'>The picture was taken back to France by Dinteville, and remained
at Polisy until the middle of the seventeenth century. By the
marriage, in 1562, of Dinteville’s niece, Claude, with François de
Cazillac, Baron de Cessac, the family estates, and with them the picture,
passed into the possession of the latter house, a distinguished family
in the south of France. In 1654 a later François de Cazillac sold Polisy,
and permanently removed to the Château of Milhars in Languedoc,
his chief residence. From the second document quoted above we
learn that De Cessac removed the picture to his town house in Paris
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>in 1653. This house was in the Rue du Four, St. Germain des Prez,
behind the house known as Chapeaufort, in the parish of St. Sulpice.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c020'><b>[86]</b></a>
From 1653 onwards there is no actual evidence as to the whereabouts
of the picture until it turned up one hundred and twenty years later
in the Beaujon sale in Paris in 1787. During his researches into its
past history Mr. W. F. Dickes discovered this sale-catalogue in the
Cabinet des Estampes in Paris.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c020'><b>[87]</b></a> Nicolas Beaujon, a rich financier
and collector of pictures and objects of art, died without heirs in 1786,
leaving all his money to charities. His pictures were sold in the following
spring, and among them were two attributed to Holbein. These
two works were not, apparently, part of Beaujon’s collection, but were
put into the sale by some other person.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c020'><b>[88]</b></a> The first, which, according
to the sale-catalogue, represented the Court of Francis II, has recently
come to light again;<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c020'><b>[89]</b></a> the second was the “Ambassadors” picture.
The two were sold together in one lot for the insignificant sum of 602
francs, and the purchaser was evidently Le Brun. The description
of the picture in the sale-catalogue tallies almost exactly with Le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Brun’s description which accompanied Pierron’s engraving. From
the sale-catalogue he obtained the supposed names of the sitters,
“MM. de Selve et d’Avaux,” and he evidently endorsed, without
troubling to make a careful examination of his own, the further statement
of the catalogue that there was no date upon it. Probably the
picture was in need of cleaning, so that both signature and date were
obscured. Mr. Wornum discovered them in 1865, and they had been
noted by others before that date. When the picture was acquired
for the National Gallery, however, the signature had again become
obscured by dirt, after the passage of some thirty years, and was only
deciphered after re-cleaning.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r89'>89</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This picture, which is the subject of a very interesting
article by Miss Mary F. S. Hervey and Mr. R. Martin-Holland in the
<i>Burlington Magazine</i> for April 1911 (vol. xviii. No. xcvii. pp.
48-55), where it is reproduced, together with other works of its
author, a forgotten French painter named Félix Chrétien, was described
in the Beaujon catalogue as “The Court of Francis II and the principal
nobles of that time, with the attributes of Moses and Aaron, who
present themselves before the King of Egypt, who is Francis II
himself; their names are written on the different contours of their
robes,” &amp;c. It further stated that it was “by the famous Holbein,
towards 1552.” From the time of the Beaujon sale in 1787 all traces of
this large panel painting—5 ft. 9 in. high by 6 ft. 2 in. wide—were
lost, until it suddenly reappeared in Messrs. Christie’s saleroom on
February 26, 1910, in company with the big group of Sir Thomas More
and Family. In the catalogue it was given to Holbein, and was
described as “Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh” (“a group of figures,
said to represent King Henry VIII as Pharaoh,” &amp;c.), and as formerly
in the collection of the Prince de Cerny. The mystery of the picture’s
meaning was cleared up, and the name of its painter discovered, by
Miss Hervey and Mr. Martin-Holland, and will be found in their paper.
It contains portraits of a number of the members of the Dinteville
family, including the Bailly of Troyes, who appears as Moses, and his
brother, François II, Bishop of Auxerre, as Aaron. The Pharaoh is
evidently Francis I, though the likeness is by no means a good one.
The names of most of the figures are given on the hems of their robes.
The picture affords valuable additional proof of the identity of the
personage on the spectator’s left in the “Ambassadors” with Jean de
Dinteville, for the likeness is striking. The picture was painted in
1537, and remained in the possession of the Dinteville family,
together with the greater work by Holbein, for exactly two hundred and
fifty years. The identity of the picture with the one in the Beaujon
sale was first pointed out by Mr. P. G. Konody (<i>Burlington
Magazine</i>, vol. xix. No. xcviii., May 1911, p. 106). Félix
Chrétien, the painter of it, was a chorister, and afterwards a canon
of Auxerre, of which town he was probably a native. He was a protégé
of the Bishop’s, and no doubt owed his training in art to him. Several
of his pictures, considerably damaged, remain in the immediate
district of Auxerre.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Although no actual proofs can be produced as to the whereabouts of
the picture between 1653 and 1787, Miss Hervey, in the course of her researches
into the history of the De Cessac family, discovered sufficient
evidence to point to the probability that M. de Cessac took it with him
to Milhars when he finally settled there a few years later, and that it remained
there until shortly before the Beaujon sale. The Milhars
estate descended from heir to heir of the house of Dinteville until 1765,
when it was sold by the Marquis de Basville, who then represented
the family. He was the intimate friend of Beaujon, who made him his
executor, in which capacity he drew up the inventory of all the banker’s
pictures and art objects. In this inventory, however, there is no trace
of Holbein’s “Ambassadors” to be found, and the inference is that as it
was included in the Beaujon sale three months later it was put into
that sale by the executor himself. It seems certain, therefore, that
from the time when the picture was taken from England by Dinteville
in 1533 until it was sent back again by Le Brun more than two hundred
and fifty years later it never once left France, but remained as a
treasured possession in the family for whose ancestor it was painted.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c020'><b>[90]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE THEORIES OF MR. DICKES</div>
<p class='c023'>In spite of the conclusive proof brought forward by Miss Hervey,
Mr. W. F. Dickes, in his book devoted to the unriddling of the “Ambassadors,”
refused to abandon his theory of the Nuremberg Treaty,
and still pinned his faith to his Princes Palatine Otto Henry and Philipp.
It is essential to his theory that Holbein should be proved to have been
absent from England in 1533, and he, therefore, gives it as his opinion
that the Steelyard portraits of that year, and the Cheseman portrait,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c020'><b>[91]</b></a>
were most probably painted abroad. He cites, as actual proof that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Holbein was in Basel in 1533, in addition to the extract from the
“Banner Book” referred to in the preceding chapter,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c020'><b>[92]</b></a> the “Wheel of
Fortune” picture in distemper at Chatsworth, which is dated 1533,
with the arms of Basel on the post supporting the wheel. “No one can
doubt,” he says, “that it was painted by Holbein at Basel in 1533;”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c020'><b>[93]</b></a>
but, as a matter of fact, it is not by Holbein at all, being far too poor
a work to be from his hand, but by Hans Schaeufelin, and the initials
“H. H.” on it are of later date. The monogram and the well-known
mark, in the form of a shovel, of the latter painter, which have been
tampered with, are still clearly discernible beneath the letters.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c020'><b>[94]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f94'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r94'>94</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As pointed out by Mr. S. Arthur Strong in his preface to
<i>The Masterpieces of the Duke of Devonshire’s Collection of
Pictures</i>, 1901, and republished in <i>Critical Studies and
Fragments</i>, 1905, p. 92, and Pl. viii. 1.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In his book Mr. Dickes abandons, or at least does not reprint, some
of the more fantastic theories he advanced in his magazine articles; but
in all that he has published on the subject his method of procedure is
the simple one of denying the authenticity of all evidence which is destructive
of his theory. Thus, he does not hesitate to declare the
first document discovered by Miss Hervey to be an eighteenth-century
forgery, and the two confirmatory papers amongst the Godefroy correspondence
he places in the same category. With regard to the date and
Holbein’s signature, he accepts as a fact the “staggering statement” of
the Beaujon sale-catalogue that in 1787 the picture was unsigned and
undated; and he infers that the inscription was added by Le Brun,
and that the three documents discovered by Miss Hervey were all
forgeries due to the same unscrupulous dealer. Why such an elaborate
falsification should be thought necessary, and what purpose it served,
unless merely to display the genealogical learning of the forger, Mr.
Dickes fails to explain. When Le Brun issued his engraving in 1792,
with a descriptive note lifted bodily from the Beaujon catalogue, and
retaining the same title, “MM. de Selve et d’Avaux,” he had already
sold the picture into England, so that to elaborate a series of forgeries in
connection with it, and then scatter them about France and get them
inserted among the papers of learned antiquaries, after the picture
had left the country, would seem to be a very futile proceeding; and if
he had added the date 1533 and a false signature to it before selling it he
would surely have refrained from stating in his printed description of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>it that it was painted in “la manière dont il a marqué ses ouvrages
<span class="lig">HB</span>. <span class="lig">BH</span>.
1515.” The
whole theory, in fact, is absurd, as is Mr. Dickes’ further
declaration that the name “Policy” on the globe is also a forgery due
to Le Brun. The inscription on the book giving the age of George de
Selve, “ætatis suæ 25,” is also a forgery according to the same
authority, or rather, he holds that the last figure was originally an
8, but that it became damaged, and that when repaired it was altered
to a 5 through the ignorance of the restorer. The alteration of the
age from 25 to 28, it should be noted, is vital to Mr. Dickes’
argument, for otherwise the second figure cannot represent Count
Philipp. Even this change, however, is not sufficient to put matters
right, and so he assumes arbitrarily that although the picture was
painted in 1533 (in spite of its forged date!) the ages of the sitters
inscribed on the dagger and the book were purposely calculated from
the previous year, in order to indicate that the painting was a
memorial of the Nuremberg Treaty of 1532. Mr. Dickes professes to find
further proofs of the ages of the sitters from the numerous
accessories on the table. The cylindrical sundial is so arranged that
it informs us that the sitter against whom it is placed was born on
April 10th, about 10.30 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, in the latitude of Neuburg,
which exactly agrees with the birth of Otto Henry, and this
information is confirmed by the decagonal sundial further along the
table. With respect to the second figure, the instruments are still
more explicit, for the date, November 12th, is repeated no less than
four times on Apian’s Torquetum, the astrolabe, and the quadrant, with
the additional information that the hour of birth was between five and
six, which exactly agrees with the day of the month and the hour of
the birth of Philipp.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c020'><b>[95]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f95'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r95'>95</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The present writer, although he has made a careful study
of Mr. Dickes’ readings of the instruments, has not sufficient
scientific knowledge to speak with authority as to the correctness or
otherwise of the results he obtains, which, if true, provide by far
the most ingenious and, indeed, the only plausible evidence he has
brought forward in favour of his theory. This evidence, however, is
not always as convincing as he would have us to believe. Thus, the
decagonal sundial, which on two of its sides gives the time as 10.30
(the hour of Otto Henry’s birth), very clearly indicates 9.30 on its
third and most prominent side, while it almost touches the elbow of
the second figure, and so should refer, if to any one, to Philipp. Mr.
Dickes gets over this difficulty by the statement that the sundial,
“presenting three circles to be read, naturally devotes the two chief
dials to the principal person. These are—the dial with the wire stile,
in front, and the dial beneath the magnet on the top;” but he offers
no suggestion as to whose birth the third and most prominent dial
refers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE ACCESSORIES OF THE PICTURE</div>
<p class='c023'>Space does not permit even a brief reference to further erroneous
inferences which Mr. Dickes draws from other parts of the picture, all of
which were fully and finally dealt with by Sir Sidney Colvin in a review
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of the book.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c020'><b>[96]</b></a> Mr. Dickes by no means strengthens his case by reproducing
a number of portraits, selected from various European galleries, in
which he sees likenesses to his two heroes, though they bear but the
faintest resemblance either to genuine portraits of the Counts Palatine
or to the sitters in the “Ambassadors” picture.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c020'><b>[97]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f96'>

</div>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f97'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r97'>97</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The two most glaring examples of this, which show to what
lengths a fixed idea can carry one, are the splendid portrait by
Holbein of the Sieur de Morette, which he declares to be painted by
Amberger, and to represent Otto Henry at some date after 1556, when he
was Elector Palatine; and the beautiful little portrait of Hermann
Wedigh, of the Steelyard, dated 1533, which, as already noted, he
holds to be an unmistakable portrait of Philipp.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The book, in spite of the false theory on which it is based, displays
much careful if misplaced research, and as, for this reason, it is apt to
mislead those who have made no serious study of Holbein’s work, its
arguments have been briefly dealt with here. Mr. Dickes, however,
is not alone in refusing to accept Jean de Dinteville and George de Selve
as the two ambassadors. Mrs. G. Fortescue, in her book on the painter,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c020'><b>[98]</b></a>
holds that both Miss Hervey and Mr. Dickes are wrong; but she brings
forward no names to take the place of those she condemns, and merely
suggests, somewhat mysteriously, that later on she will produce facts
which will provide the correct solution.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f98'>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Turning again to the picture itself, it is evident that the accessories,
with which the table is crowded, both from their unusual number
and character, were not collected at haphazard merely to afford an
opportunity for displaying Holbein’s skill in depicting minutiæ, but
that they represent the tastes and learned pursuits of the two sitters,
and were selected and arranged by Dinteville himself. The prevailing
love of allegory and symbolism, of the emblem or “devise,” which was
a marked characteristic of that age, is apparent in many of the picture’s
details, in some of them to be read plainly, in others so obscurely that it
is now impossible to explain them satisfactorily. Miss Hervey has
described them with care, and has elucidated much of their meaning and
purpose. The appearance of the Death’s-head twice over in the
picture—in the hat-medal worn by Dinteville and in the distorted skull
in the foreground—seems to indicate that the ambassador had adopted
it as his personal badge or <i>devise</i>. The picture, indeed, in its general
arrangement bears considerable likeness to the woodcut in the “Dance
of Death” series known as “The Arms of Death” (“Die Wappen des
Todes”), as was first pointed out by Mr. Wornum.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c020'><b>[99]</b></a> This suggests the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>possibility that Dinteville had been shown, perhaps by Holbein himself,
a proof set of the “Dance of Death” woodcuts, and that he had been
greatly impressed by them. He suffered much from ill-health while in
England, which may have had something to do with his choice of a
device of so gloomy a nature.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f99'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r99'>99</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wornum, p. 181.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Certain of the instruments depicted are apparently set to indicate
various dates, such as the birthdays of the sitters or important events in
their lives, as pointed out by Mr. Dickes. The same instruments, together
with the other objects, also represent certain of the Seven Liberal
Arts—Music, Arithmetic, Geometry and Astronomy. The terrestrial
globe is copied from Johann Schöner’s globe of 1523, to which about
twenty names of towns have been added by Holbein, chiefly in France
and Spain, selected by Dinteville as an epitome of the foreign relations
of France in shaping which he had taken some share, the most important
of these additions, as elucidating the identity of the chief sitter, being, of
course, Polisy. The Lutheran hymn-book and the crucifix may be
taken as symbolical of France’s religious diplomacy and the opinions
of the two friends. The hope of religious union between the Roman
Catholic and the Reformed Churches played a large part in the life of
the Bishop of Lavaur. “To find means to promote that end was the
object of his most earnest thought; to see it accomplished, the dearest
wish of his heart.”<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c020'><b>[100]</b></a> Dinteville, too, belonged to the liberal Catholic
party in France, and shared the Bishop’s views. Mr. Barclay Squire
first pointed out that the hymn-book in the picture was painted from
a copy of Johann Walther’s <i>Geystliche Gesangbüchlein</i>, published at
Wittemberg in 1524. The German arithmetic book was copied from
a manual, <i>The Merchant’s Arithmetic Book</i>, by Peter Apian, published
at Ingoldstadt in 1527. The badge of the order of St. Michael is
worn by Dinteville without the collar of scallop-shells, and merely
suspended from his neck by a gold chain. This was in accordance with
the rules of the Order, which permitted it to be so worn when under
arms, or when travelling, hunting, or when at home in private, or in
other places where there was no company. Other details of the picture
are equally interesting, more particularly the elaborate mosaic pavement,
which Miss Hervey discovered to be an accurate copy of the
well-known paved floor in the Sanctuary of Westminster Abbey, for the
construction of which marbles and workmen were brought from Italy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>by Abbot Richard Ware in the reign of Henry III. This interesting
discovery affords additional proof that the “Ambassadors” was
painted in England.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE ACCESSORIES OF THE PICTURE</div>
<p class='c023'>The picture, which in point of size and in the elaboration of its
many details is the most important work by Holbein remaining in
England, is a brilliant example of the painter’s technical abilities,
though as a composition it is less successful than certain other less
ambitious portraits from his brush. The accessories, on account of
their number, variety, and brilliance of execution, and the central
position given to them—so that the two figures have something of the
appearance of the supporters to a coat of arms, as in some of Holbein’s
designs for glass—to some extent distract the attention from the
ambassadors themselves. Dinteville appears to have selected them
with great care, and evidently attached great importance to them and
the meanings they were intended to convey; while the painter carried
out his wishes so admirably that they remain to-day almost as important
a part of the picture as they did in the opinion of the man for whom
the work was painted. The distorted skull, in particular, which at once
catches the eye, however entertaining or clever a rebus or emblematic
puzzle the Bailly may have thought it, holds far too prominent a
position in the composition for the painting to be regarded as a picture
in the highest sense of the word. It is, nevertheless, a work possessing
very great qualities, and, in many respects, must be placed in the forefront
of Holbein’s achievement. The faces of the two men are finely
and delicately modelled, though their character is not quite so subtly
expressed as in such a portrait as that of the “Duchess of Milan.” The
dark, penetrating eyes and well-chiselled mouth of Dinteville give
vitality to his intellectual face, in which can be traced some indications
of the delicate constitution which was so ill suited to the climate of
England. De Selve is grave in contrast, with dark eyebrows and a
more pallid complexion, and his countenance has less expression and
vitality than is to be found in that of his companion. It has been suggested
that this contrast between the two figures is so great that it
indicates the fact proved by Dinteville’s letter, that the future Bishop’s
stay in this country was of limited duration, and that his portrait was
probably not completed from life.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>“PORTRAIT OF A MUSICIAN”</div>
<p class='c023'>In concluding this account of Dinteville’s connection with Holbein
reference must be made to a portrait in the possession of Sir John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Ramsden, Bt., of Bulstrode Park, Buckingham, recently published and
described for the first time by Dr. Ganz in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c020'><b>[101]</b></a>
which represents a man with a book of music and a lute (<a href='#pl-10'>Pl. 10</a>). This
“Portrait of a Musician” he regards as an undoubted likeness of the
Bailly of Troyes from Holbein’s brush. He describes it as follows: “The
man is sitting behind a table, and holds in his right hand a roll of paper,
in the left a guitar. Two books in red bindings with green ribbons are
placed, one open, one closed, on the red tablecloth, and this group of
colours forms the contrast to the green curtain of the background. The
cap and the black coat with large facings and white shirt-ruffles hanging
down are decorated with golden buttags of a longish form, after the
French fashion of the time. The blue eyes, looking with a sharp and cold
glance, give the impression of a man of great reflection and prudence;
and the beautiful, carefully tended hands belong to a gentleman of the
Court.... Round the neck he wears a small golden chain and a
black silk ribbon, to which is attached an object of a very singular form,
executed in gold and embellished with precious stones. This cannot be
a simple jewel, intended merely to hang on the gold chain, but it seems to
be a kind of whistle used in place of a tuning-fork.”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c020'><b>[102]</b></a> This portrait is
said to represent Lord Vaux of Harrowden, from its supposed resemblance
to the two drawings by Holbein of that personage at Windsor,
but Dr. Ganz holds that it bears a much closer resemblance to Dinteville
as he is shown in the “Ambassadors,” and still more so to the
drawing found by Miss Hervey at Chantilly. He considers that the
longer beard indicates that it was painted two years later than the
National Gallery picture. “The technical execution,” he says, “confirms
a later date of origin; the blending of the colours and the brilliancy
are in the well-preserved parts like the finest enamel. The right
hand, which has a smooth appearance, is retouched; but the extraordinary
quality of Holbein’s art in modelling the flesh without any
contrast is to be found in the face and in the execution of the left hand.
His attention was not limited to creating a portrait with the exactness
of a looking-glass; he tried to give the man in his intimacy by obtaining
a spacious effect. He placed the figure between two objects and painted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the shadows in their real values.” While admitting that the likeness
between this Musician and Dinteville is a strong one, the present
writer is of opinion that the picture at Bulstrode Park does not represent
the French ambassador. As already pointed out,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c020'><b>[103]</b></a> Dinteville’s subsequent
visits to England were all short ones, of only a few weeks’ duration,
during which time there would be little opportunity for sitting for his
portrait, nor is it very probable that he would want a second likeness
of himself so shortly after the big work was finished. Little is known
of the history of Sir John Ramsden’s picture, but it is probably the
<i>ritratto d’un Musico</i> of the Arundel inventory. It is said to have been
purchased in 1860 from a sale in Scotland. Either this picture, or a
replica of it, was in the Ralph Bernal sale, 1855, when it was sold to
Mr. Morant for one hundred guineas. It was described in the sale
catalogue as: “Portrait of Nicholas, Lord Vaux, the poet and
musician, in a black dress and cap, seated at a table, an open book
before him, he holds a viol de gambe in his left hand, green drapery
behind, 17½ × 17, a most beautiful portrait of the highest interest.”</p>

THERE is only one portrait by Holbein bearing the date
1533 which can be said with any certainty to represent
an Englishman. This is the very beautiful one of
Robert Cheseman, now in the Hague Gallery, which
has been known for so long under the erroneous title of
“Henry VIII’s Falconer” (<a href='#pl-11'>Pl. 11</a>).<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c020'><b>[104]</b></a> It represents
a man holding a much higher social position than that of a mere keeper
of hawks. Henry’s falconers were paid at a rate which did not permit
them to employ the services of the leading artist of the day should
they wish—which is not at all probable—to have their portraits painted.
Their wages, in fact, ranged between fifty and twenty shillings a
month. Cheseman, in common with other gentlemen of that period,
chose to be painted with his favourite hawk upon his wrist, for the
same reason that the country squires of the eighteenth century were
so often depicted with their favourite dogs. Another example of this
habit is to be seen in the equally fine portrait by Holbein of an unknown
man, also in the Hague Gallery, dated 1542, who is evidently a gentleman,
and not a professional falconer.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c020'><b>[105]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF ROBERT CHESEMAN</div>
<p class='c023'>Robert Cheseman, of Dormanswell, near Norwood, in Middlesex,
and Northcote, in Essex, was a man of wealth, and one of the leading
commoners of the first-named county. He was born in 1485, son and
heir of Edward Cheseman, Cofferer and Keeper of the Wardrobe to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Henry VII, and succeeded to the family estates in 1517. His father
is mentioned in a pardon granted on March 2nd, 1486,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c020'><b>[106]</b></a> “to Edward
Cheseman of London, gentleman, of all fines, forfeitures, etc., due to
the King or to Richard III, late, in deed and not of right, King of
England,” which was granted him as one of the executors of the will
of Thomas Windesore, Constable of Windsor Castle. There was also
a William Cheseman, probably an uncle of Robert, who in 1485 and
1486 received grants of the offices of bailiff of the rapes of Lewes and
of Braneburgh, and of Clerk of the Market of the town of Lewes, “in
consideracion of the true and feithfulle service that our welbeloved
servaunt and true liegeman William Cheseman hathe doone unto
us, as well in the parties of beyonde the see, as at oure late victorious
felde within this oure royaume.”<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c020'><b>[107]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>On August 30th, 1523, Robert Cheseman was appointed Commissioner
for Essex to collect the subsidy,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c020'><b>[108]</b></a> and in December 1528
was placed upon the commission of the peace for Middlesex. In 1530
he represented the same county on a commission “to make inquisition
in different counties concerning the possessions held by Thomas
Cardinal Archbishop of York (Wolsey) on 2 Dec. 15 Hen. VIII, when
the Cardinal committed certain offences against the Crown for which
he was attainted.”<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c020'><b>[109]</b></a> During his life he served on a number of commissions
for collecting tithes, subsidies, and the like, including one in
1533, the year in which he sat to Holbein. In 1536 his name appears
among a list of people from whom money is due to the King by obligations,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c020'><b>[110]</b></a>
while in the same year he supplied thirty men for the army
against the Northern rebels, which proves him to have been a man of
considerable substance.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c020'><b>[111]</b></a> He served on the Grand Jury at the trials
of Sir Geoffrey Pole, Sir Edward Neville, and others, in 1538,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c020'><b>[112]</b></a> and of
Thomas Culpeper and Francis Dereham for treason in connection with
the trial of Queen Catherine Howard in 1541.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c020'><b>[113]</b></a> He was among the
“squires” selected to welcome Anne of Cleves when she first landed
in England, and was, in fact, one of some half-dozen men of position
who represented Middlesex on all such public occasions. In 1543 he
supplied ten footmen for the army going into Flanders “for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>defence of the Emperor’s Low Countries,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c020'><b>[114]</b></a> and in the following year he
himself appears to have gone with the English army into France, and
it is noted against his name in the muster book that he had “10 footmen
already beyond the seas.” He married Alice, daughter of Henry
Dacres, of Mayfield, Staffordshire, a merchant-tailor and alderman of
Fleet Street, London. She died on July 31st, 1547, and was buried
at Norwood. His daughter and heir, Anne Cheseman, married Francis
Chamberlayne.</p>

<p class='c023'>The portrait of Cheseman is a half-length, facing the spectator,
the head and eyes turned to the left. He wears a purplish red silk
doublet, and a black cloak trimmed with fur, and the customary black
cap. On his left hand, which is gloved, he carries a hooded hawk,
with a bell on its claw, and with the other hand strokes its feathers.
He is clean-shaven, and his long hair, which is beginning to turn grey,
covers his ears. Across the plain blue background, which has turned
green through the discoloration of the varnish, on either side of the
sitter’s head, runs the inscription in Roman lettering:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The painting of the beautiful plumage of the bird is a most masterly
piece of work, and the keen, piercing eyes and clean-cut face of its
master are rendered with that unerring truth and wonderful insight
which give Holbein his foremost place among the supreme painters of
portraits.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF ROBERT CHESEMAN</div>
<p class='c023'>This picture was seen by Sir Joshua Reynolds during his tour
through Flanders and Holland in 1781, and in his diary he describes
it as:—“A portrait by Holbein; admirable for its truth and precision
and extremely well coloured. The blue flat ground which is behind
the head gives a general effect of dryness to the picture: had the
ground been varied, and made to harmonize more with the figure, this
portrait might have stood in competition with the works of the best
portrait painters.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c020'><b>[115]</b></a> This accusation of a slight “dryness” is to some
extent true of certain, though by no means all, of the portraits painted
by Holbein in England, when compared with some of his earlier work
done in Basel. It has been suggested that this may have been due to
a growing habit, caused by the increasing demands made upon his time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of placing greater reliance on his preliminary chalk studies in painting
a portrait, and thereby reducing the number of sittings given him by
the actual model.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c020'><b>[116]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>An old copy of this portrait was lent to the Tudor Exhibition,
1890 (No. 173<span class='fss'>A</span>), by the Rev. Charles Shepherd. The original picture
was once in the royal collections of England. It was No. 8 on the list
of objects of art which Queen Anne reclaimed from the Dutch States
at the death of William III as having formed part of the collection
belonging to the English royal house. Her claim was unsuccessful, and
the picture remained in Holland. On the back of the panel are the
letters <span class='fss'>W.E.H.P.L.C.</span> and the seal of Johan Willem Friso, Prince of
Orange-Nassau, in whose collection it was, and afterwards in that of
William V. The second fine portrait of a man with a hawk in the
Hague Gallery,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c020'><b>[117]</b></a> dated 1542, was another of the pictures claimed by
Anne, and was No. 21 in her list. A third picture in the Hague,
the beautiful portrait of a young woman<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c020'><b>[118]</b></a> (No. 275), now considered
to represent Holbein’s wife, has been already described. The Cheseman
and the 1542 portrait were evidently taken over to Holland,
with other paintings, by William III during one of his visits to the
Hague.</p>

in Brussels,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c020'><b>[119]</b></a> is dated 1533. According to both
Woltmann and Zahn it is in a very damaged condition, but is a genuine
work of Holbein. It represents a young man at half-length, facing
the spectator, but with the head slightly turned to the left. He is
clean-shaven, with bushy hair half hiding his ears, and wears the small
flat black cap and costume of the German merchants of the Steelyard,
and he was probably a member of that body. The right hand only is
shown, holding a carnation. Across the plain background, on either
side of the head, is inscribed “<span class='fss'>ANNO 1533</span>.” The face is a very
attractive one, and the portrait has for years been regarded as representing
the painter himself. Dr. Woltmann so included it in his book,
but it bears little resemblance to the genuine portraits of Holbein.
It was previously in the Jäger, Gsell, and Fräulein Gabriele Przibram
collections in Vienna.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF THOMAS CROMWELL</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>During 1533, or in the first months of 1534, Holbein painted Thomas
Cromwell. The future Earl of Essex and “viceregent of the King in
all his ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the realm” was then only at
the beginning of his political career, and filled the minor post of Master
of the Jewel House. The portrait of him in the possession of the Earl
of Caledon,<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c020'><b>[120]</b></a> at Tyttenhanger Park, St. Albans, which is evidently the
original of several versions still in existence, although it has suffered
greatly in the course of time, must be regarded as a genuine work of
Holbein’s brush. The face has undergone severe repainting, but in
many of the details his hand can be clearly traced. On one of the
papers on the table in front of the sitter is the following address: “To
our trusty and right wellbiloved Counsailler Thomas Cromwell, Maister
of o<b>r</b> Jewelhouse,” which proves that it cannot have been painted later
than the first months of 1534, for early in that year Cromwell was
promoted to be First Secretary of State and Master of the Rolls. He
must, therefore, have sat to Holbein at some date between the latter
half of 1532 and the spring of 1534, having been appointed to the
Jewel House on the 12th April 1532 in place of Robert Amadas, the
jeweller. If done after his advancement, his higher titles would have
been noted in the inscription.</p>

p. 7; Ganz, <i>Holbein</i>, p. 106.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>It is very possible that Cromwell first made the acquaintance of
Holbein through their common friends, the merchants of the Steelyard,
with whom the future Lord Privy Seal was closely allied in more
than one business transaction, more particularly in connection with
the wool trade, of which the Hanse merchants then had a monopoly.
He also made constant use of their services later on in his career for
the collection of continental news, the forwarding of diets to various
English ambassadors abroad, the translating of foreign letters, and so
on.</p>

<p class='c023'>Eustace Chapuys, the Spanish Ambassador in London, in reply
to a query from his Imperial master as to the character of Henry’s
new minister, sent, in November 1535, a short and amusing biographical
sketch of his career, interesting as showing how Cromwell appeared
in the eyes of a foreigner.</p>

<p class='c023'>“The Secretary, Cromwell,” he wrote, “is the son of a poor farrier,
who lived in a little village a league and a half from here (London), and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>is buried in the parish graveyard. His uncle, father of the cousin
whom he has already made rich, was cook (<i>cousinier</i>) of the late archbishop
of Canterbury. Cromwell was ill-behaved when young, and
after an imprisonment was forced to leave the country. He went to
Flanders, Rome, and elsewhere in Italy. When he returned he married
the daughter of a shearman, and served in his house; he then became
a solicitor. The cardinal of York, seeing his vigilance and diligence,
his ability and promptitude, both in evil and good, took him into his
service, and employed him principally in demolishing five or six good
monasteries. At the Cardinal’s fall no one behaved better to him than
Cromwell. After the Cardinal’s death Wallop attacked him with insults
and threats, and for protection he procured an audience of the King,
and promised to make him the richest king that ever was in England.
The King immediately retained him on his Council, but told no one for
four months. Now he stands above everyone but the Lady (Anne
Boleyn), and everyone considers he has more credit with his master
than Wolsey had—in whose time there were others who shared his
credit, as Maistre Conton (Compton), the duke of Suffolk, and others,
but now there is no one else who does anything. The Chancellor is
only his minister. Cromwell would not accept the office hitherto,
but it is thought that soon he will allow himself to be persuaded to
take it. He speaks well in his own language, and tolerably in Latin,
French and Italian; is hospitable, liberal both with his property and
with gracious words, magnificent in his household and in building.”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c020'><b>[121]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f121'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r121'>121</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>C.L.P.</i>, vol. ix. 862.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>This is the man whom Holbein painted when he was merely Master
of the Jewel House and Clerk of the Hanaper of Chancery. He is
shown, in Lord Caledon’s picture, at half-length, seated in a high-backed
wooden seat, his head and body turned to the left, looking
towards a window, only a small part of which is seen, with a small
table beneath it covered with a Turkish cloth, on which papers are
placed. He is dressed in a black surcoat with a deep fur collar, and a
black cap. He rests his left elbow on another table in front of him,
and holds a paper in his left hand, on the first finger of which is a heavy
signet ring. The right hand is not shown. He is clean-shaven, and
his bushy hair almost covers his ears and falls on the back of his neck.
On the table are pen and ink, a richly-bound book with jewelled clasps,
and several papers, on one of which is the inscription already quoted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>On a second paper the word “Counseilor” can be deciphered at the
head. The face, with its small eyes set closely together, its thin, compressed
lips and double chin, and its sinister expression of cold determination,
is a far from attractive one, and lays bare that side of Cromwell’s
character for which he was so heartily hated by the Catholic
party. In it is to be seen little of that other side of him, of which,
after his downfall, Cranmer spoke, when writing to Henry on behalf
of his old minister. “Cromwell,” he said, “was such a servant in my
judgment, in wisdom, diligence, faithfulness, and experience, as no
prince in this realm ever had.” A large scroll stretching across the
top of the picture, evidently added after Cromwell’s death, contains a
Latin inscription in his praise. The portrait is on panel, 30 in. × 24 in.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAITS OF THOMAS CROMWELL</div>
<p class='c023'>A smaller portrait of Cromwell, a circular painting with a green
background, and enclosed in a painted square stone frame, showing
the head only, is described by Wornum and Woltmann.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c020'><b>[122]</b></a> It was at
that time in the possession of Captain Ridgway, of Waterloo Place,
London.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c020'><b>[123]</b></a> It is 12 in. square, and differs in some details from the
Tyttenhanger portrait. Both writers appear to regard it as a genuine
work by Holbein. A portrait of Cromwell was one of the few works
mentioned by name by Van Mander when describing De Loo’s collection
of Holbein’s works:—“the old Lord Crauwl, about a foot and a
half high, taken unusually artistically by Holbein.” Although the
dimensions do not quite agree, Woltmann suggests that Captain
Ridgway’s little picture was the one thus described. According to
Mr. Lionel Cust,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c020'><b>[124]</b></a> the few portraits of Cromwell which have any claim
to authenticity are all traceable to Holbein, and fall into two groups,
or at most three, each group deriving from an original portrait by him.
In the first class are the Tyttenhanger picture and others based directly
upon it. This portrait, he says, descends direct from Sir Thomas
Pope, one of Cromwell’s instruments in the suppression of the
monasteries. The second group includes such pictures as the one in
the National Portrait Gallery (No. 1683, 16¾ in. × 13 in.),<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c020'><b>[125]</b></a> purchased
in 1897, of which there are several versions in existence, though there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>is no portrait of this type so far traced which can be attributed to Holbein
himself. The pictures in this group show the head and shoulders
only, and differ in minor details from the Tyttenhanger type. The
look of craftiness is accentuated, and he is shown with a slight grey
whisker, and the pointed arch of the eyebrows is more strongly marked.
The third group, which is closely allied to the second, includes the
recently-discovered miniature in the late Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan’s collection,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c020'><b>[126]</b></a>
and the medal in the British Museum, of the date 1538, which,
according to Mr. Cust, is evidently based on a drawing by Holbein.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c020'><b>[127]</b></a>
There was a portrait of Cromwell in the Arundel collection, which
is entered in the inventory as “ritratto de Cromwell.” This was
evidently the one in the possession of De Loo, which afterwards
passed, with other works by Holbein, from that dealer’s collection
into that of the Earl. Hollar’s engraving,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c020'><b>[128]</b></a> which is not signed
or dated, does not appear to have been taken from the portrait at
Tyttenhanger, but was most probably based upon the Arundel
picture; but whether that picture was an original by Holbein, now
lost, or one of the numerous versions now in existence, it is impossible
to say. One of these versions is in the collection of M. Ch. Léon
Cardon, Brussels.</p>

<p class='c023'>Several portraits of Cromwell were included in the Tudor Exhibition,
1890, wrongly attributed to Holbein. Among them was a bust
portrait, to the right, with a jewel in the cap, and the Garter George
suspended from a black ribbon, lent by the Duke of Sutherland (No.
39, 20 in. × 17 in.); a small half-length, to the left, wearing both collar
and George of the Garter, from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge
(No. 160, 22½ in. × 17 in.); and versions of the Tyttenhanger picture
lent by Mr. Charles Penruddocke (No. 162, 18 in. × 16 in.), and the
Duke of Manchester (No. 163, 14 in. × 11½ in.).<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c020'><b>[129]</b></a> In addition to the
Hollar print, engravings were made, from one or other of the copies
of the original picture, by Houbraken for his <i>Heads of Illustrious
Persons</i>, 1745, from a picture in the possession of Mr. Edward
Southwell, and by Freeman for Lodge’s <i>Portraits</i>, 1835, the latter from
a picture in the possession of Sir Thomas Constable, Bt., at Tixall.
Probably both engravings were done from the same painting.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>There is a magnificent drawing, one of the most powerful studies
Holbein ever accomplished, in the collection of the Earl of Pembroke
and Montgomery at Wilton House,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c020'><b>[130]</b></a> which until recently has been
generally regarded as a portrait of the Lord Privy Seal—though it
bears little likeness to the Tyttenhanger panel—because the words
“Lord Cromwell” and “Holbein” have been inscribed in the bottom
corners by a later hand than the painter’s. It is in black and red chalk
on paper tinted pink, with slight touches of colour on the fur of the
gown and the jewel in the cap. The outlines of the features have
been reinforced in ink, but this, in contradistinction to some of the
drawings in the Windsor collection, where such retouching is evidently
from a later hand, has been carried out with such power combined with
delicacy that it seems certain that it was done by Holbein himself.
The drawing evidently at one time formed part of the Windsor series,
at the date when the latter was given by Charles I to an earlier Earl
of Pembroke in exchange for the little “St. George” by Raphael,
which is now in the Hermitage. This book of drawings was afterwards
given by Pembroke to the Earl of Arundel, and it is most probable
that the so-called “Cromwell” drawing remained behind, perhaps
by accident. Quite recently it has been definitely identified as the
portrait of George Nevill, third Lord Abergavenny, by means of a
miniature in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch, in water-colours,
on a playing card, which is based on Holbein’s drawing, and is inscribed
“G. Abergaveny.”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c020'><b>[131]</b></a> It bears a very strong likeness to the drawing,
and is attributed to Holbein himself. Further proof of identity is
obtained from a picture, which agrees with the miniature but does
not show the hands, in the collection of the Marquis of Abergavenny
at Edridge Castle, Kent. Both the Wilton drawing and the miniature
were included in the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition, 1909
(No. 70 and Case C. No. 22), and the former was in the Tudor Exhibition,
1890 (No. 1414).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF MORETTE</div>
<p class='c023'>Singularly few examples remain of work executed by Holbein in
1534 and 1535. There are no dated portraits from his brush of the
former year, with the exception of the two small roundels in Vienna,
and none of the latter year, for the date on the beautiful miniature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>little Henry Brandon at Windsor, usually given as 1535, has been
misread.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c020'><b>[132]</b></a> There are one or two portraits which must have been done
during this period, among them the Morette, the drawing of Nicolas
Bourbon, and a portrait of Nicholas Poyns the younger; but there
are so few examples which can be definitely given to these two years
that the writer hazards the conjecture that for a part of the time
Holbein was out of England. Throughout his too short career the
painter seems never to have severed his connection with Basel, nor to
have broken the friendly relationships which existed between him and
its Council. He remained a citizen of his adopted city, and apparently
retained his membership of the Painters’ Guild, until his death. To
do so he must have paid some heed to the somewhat strict laws as to
the duties of citizenship then in force. The customary leave of absence
was about two years, and Holbein may well have returned to Basel
more often than is generally supposed. He did not accede to the
Council’s request contained in their letter of September 2nd, 1532, but
at the end of two years, in the summer of 1534, he may possibly have
paid a visit of some duration to Switzerland, returning to England in
the summer or autumn of 1535. This is only conjecture, for there
is no evidence of his presence in Basel during that period, but it would
account for the lack of English portraits of that date, and would also
help to explain the fact—in some ways inexplicable—that he did not
enter the service of the royal house of England until about 1536.
Against this assumption it must be noted that when he paid his well-known
visit to Basel in September 1538 he was feasted and fêted by
his fellow-citizens in a way which seems to indicate that he had been
absent for a longer period than three years. Still, it is not impossible that
he was there in 1534-5, and that he even paid a final visit home, about
the winter of 1540-41, before his death in 1543, in this way retaining
until the end his citizenship and the pension paid by the Basel
authorities to his wife.</p>

<p class='c023'>The wonderful portrait of Morette in the Dresden Gallery (<a href='#pl-12'>Pl. 12</a>)<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c020'><b>[133]</b></a>
must certainly have been painted during the period under discussion.
Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette, a well-known French diplomatist
and fighting man of his day, who had paid more than one earlier visit
to England, in each case of short duration, arrived in London as French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>resident ambassador in place of Castillon, on Good Friday, April 3rd,
1534, and returned to France on July 26th, 1535. This was his last
and longest sojourn in this country, and Holbein must have painted
him between these two dates. Even though the painter may have
paid a visit to Basel as suggested, it would still leave ample time for
the portrait to have been taken in the summer of either year. Probably
Holbein’s introduction to Morette was brought about through
the good offices of Jean de Dinteville. Though the Bailly of Troyes
had left England in the previous November, Morette may have seen
the “Ambassadors” picture in France in the interval, or have heard
of it from Castillon, who succeeded Dinteville in London. In any
case, Morette, who was one of the special ambassadors who came over
for the signing of the treaty in the spring of 1528, was acquainted with
at least one work of Holbein, the “Battle of Spurs,” in the temporary
banqueting-hall at Greenwich, to which the King had drawn the
particular notice of the envoys.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE ARUNDEL COLLECTION</div>
<p class='c023'>The first known reference to the portrait of Morette occurs in the
correspondence of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, the
great collector of Holbein’s work, who employed friends and agents
on the Continent to hunt up and buy everything from his brush that
they could discover. He got together a remarkably fine series of
pictures and drawings by Holbein, which, on his death at Padua, 1646,
came into the possession of his widow, then residing in Holland. Upon
her decease in 1654, at Amsterdam, her youngest son, Lord Stafford,
who was living with her, propounded a nuncupative will in his own
favour, and began as quickly as he could to sell the pictures, which
it had been the intention of the Earl should become heirlooms, but
the deed had never been executed. The sale, however, was stopped
by other representatives of the Arundel family, and a lawsuit resulted.
Among the documents in connection with these proceedings was one
of very great interest, an inventory of the pictures and objects of art
in the possession of the Countess at the time of her death. The original
list, which was in Italian, and probably drawn up for the Earl in Padua,
has disappeared, but a copy of it has been recently discovered by Miss
Mary L. Cox in the Record Office. This valuable document was evidently
copied from the original by some clerk in Amsterdam ignorant
of the Italian language, for it is full of mistakes. The complete inventory
was published by Miss Cox, with an introduction by Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Lionel Cust, in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c020'><b>[134]</b></a> From it we learn that
Lord Arundel possessed no less than forty-one works by or attributed
to Holbein, in addition to the drawings, which are not included in the
inventory. Among the portraits, some of which have been already
noted, were those of the Duchess of Milan, Jane Seymour, Anne of
Cleves, Edward VI, the Duke of Norfolk and his son the Earl of Surrey,
Sir Thomas Wyat, Cromwell, Erasmus, the Earl of Southampton,
Thomas and John Godsalve, Sir Edward Gage, Sir Henry and Lady
Guldeford, Archbishop Warham, Dr. John Chamber, Derich Born,
and Sir Thomas More and his family, as well as several unnamed portraits,
to all of which reference will be found in these pages. Very
possibly some few of these pictures, such as the full-length of the Earl
of Surrey, were not by Holbein, though given to him in the list. Lord
Arundel also possessed several works which so far have not been traced,
though the titles may help towards their future rediscovery. Among
them is a portrait said to be of Holbein’s wife, which is most probably
the picture at the Hague;<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c020'><b>[135]</b></a> one of a lady “con gli mani giunti e un
agato atacato al beretino”; another of a lady, aged 40, with the inscription,
“In all things, Lord, thy wilbe fulfilled”; the portrait of a
musician;<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c020'><b>[136]</b></a> one of an armed man, which may possibly be the portrait
of Sir Nicholas Carew; the portrait of the goldsmith Hans of Zürich; the
Death’s-head and bones already referred to in speaking of Ambrosius
Holbein; a picture of gamblers or people playing games (“un quadretto
con divers figure Jocatori, &amp;c.”); another with the title “Legge
Vecchio &amp; Nove” (ancient and modern law); and the Arms of England
in water-colours. Before his relations could interfere Lord
Stafford had sold a number of pictures to the Spanish Ambassador in
London, to Eberhard Jabach, of Cologne, and to the agent of the Archduke
Leopold, and this may account for the fact that certain of them
remained abroad, such as the Jane Seymour and Dr. Chamber in
Vienna, and the Thomas and John Godsalve in Dresden.</p>

<p class='c023'>In a letter from Turin, dated November 26th, 1628, from Sir Isaac
Wake to William Boswell, the former states: “The picture after
which you do seem to inquire was made by Hans Holbein in the time
of Henry VIII, and is of a Count of Moretta. My Lord of Arundel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>doth desire it, and if I can get it at any reasonable price he must and
shall have it.”<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c020'><b>[137]</b></a> The picture was evidently then in the market, under
the true names of both sitter and painter, but apparently the price was
too high, and so Arundel, who possessed the original drawing for it,
was not able to secure it. It was eventually bought by the Marquis
Massimiliano Montecucculi, ambassador of the house of Este at Parma
and Rome, and presented by him to the Duke Francesco d’Este, and
so passed into the Modena gallery. According to Venturi, the portrait
was at that time attributed by the Marquis Montecucculi to “Gio.
Olben.” Some thirty years after the date of Wake’s letter, Scannelli,
in his <i>Microcosmo</i>,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c020'><b>[138]</b></a> describes, under the name of “Olbeno,” a picture
in the Modena collection which can be no other than the “Morette.”
He says: “There was also lately among ultramontane painters a
certain Olbeno, a highly qualified master, and in painting individual
portraits verily stupendous. It is true in his execution there is something
of that native hardness which belongs to his country in other
respects; yet through his extreme diligence and truthful fidelity to
nature it shows a high degree of perfection. As we see, for example,
in the already noticed gallery of H.S.H. the Duke of Modena, where
there is a half-length portrait by him which in its exact imitation of
nature is quite wonderful.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF MORETTE</div>
<p class='c023'>At a later date the true name of the sitter appears to have become
lost. It has been suggested<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c020'><b>[139]</b></a> that, owing to the similarity of the sound,
the name Morette was first changed to Morus, as the name of Sir Thomas
More would naturally suggest itself in connection with Holbein. In
Italy, Morus, again naturally, would become Moro, and so in course
of time the picture was said to represent Lodovico Sforza, familiarly
known as Il Moro. There is no need, however, to bring in the name
of Sir Thomas More at all. The change must have been directly from
Morette to Maurus, which was Sforza’s second name, from which his
popular nickname “Il Moro” was taken.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c020'><b>[140]</b></a> Holbein’s name in connection
with the picture having been by this time forgotten, the title
“Maurus,” combined with the beauty of the work, gave rise to the
supposition that it could only be from the hand of Sforza’s great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>countryman, Leonardo da Vinci; and it was as a portrait of Il Moro
by Leonardo that it was purchased by Augustus III, King of Poland
and Elector of Saxony, from the Duke Francesco of Este-Modena in
1746. It formed part of a collection of about one hundred pictures,
known as the “Modena Gallery,” some of which are now among the
chief masterpieces of the Dresden Gallery, which, after long and
secret negotiations, the Elector procured for his own collection at the
cost of one hundred thousand sequins and very liberal largesse to
various agents and go-betweens. For the next hundred years it
remained at Dresden as a portrait of Lodovico and a masterpiece
by Da Vinci. Then Rumohr, the critic, pointed out that the style
and quality of the painting proved it to be an undoubted work by
Holbein, while at the same time Von Quandt produced evidence to
show that it did not represent Il Moro, but a certain jeweller
employed by Henry VIII named Hubert Morett. The paper he contributed
to the <i>Kunstblatt</i> in 1846 was accompanied by a reproduction
of Hollar’s engraving of the original drawing of the picture,
upon which his case was based. This engraving is inscribed “Mr.
Morett” and “W. Hollar fecit, ex Collectione Arundeliana. A<b>o</b> 1647.
31 Decē.” In spite of Rumohr’s criticism, however, the picture continued
to be described in the official catalogues as by Leonardo, the
authorities, it is said, objecting to the change of name, as in so doing
the collection would be robbed of its sole work by Da Vinci; and it
was not until the death of King Frederick Augustus that Holbein was
allowed to come into his own again. There was considerable opposition,
too, to the change from Il Moro to Mr. Morett, the goldsmith,
Hollar’s engraving being a poor one, and not very much like the picture.
The title was not changed, nor was the final restitution made to Holbein
until 1860, in which year Holbein’s original drawing for the portrait
made its appearance in London, in the sale of Samuel Woodburne, the
art dealer, when it fetched £43, and was purchased immediately afterwards
for the Saxon Government by Herr L. Gruner, the director of
the Dresden Gallery.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c020'><b>[141]</b></a> For the next twenty-five years the picture
was known as “Mr. Hubert Morett, goldsmith to Henry VIII,” who
was considered by all writers to be an Englishman, his sumptuous
apparel, quite unlike the sober garments worn by jewellers in those
days, being explained away by a reference to the tradition that in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>sixteenth century all Englishmen, of whatever class of society, had a
passion for finery in dress.</p>

<p class='c023'>As a matter of fact Hubert Morett was not an Englishman at all,
nor could he be rightly described as “goldsmith” to Henry VIII.
He was a Frenchman, one of several jewellers of Paris, who paid
periodical visits to London for the purpose of selling their wares to
the King and Court. Thus, in August 1536, in Gostwick’s accounts, is
the entry: “Hubbert Morret, jeweller of Paris, for jewels bought by
the King £282, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,”<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c020'><b>[142]</b></a> while in January 1532 he
received 242 crowns, or £56, 9<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, for similar
goods.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c020'><b>[143]</b></a> Granger’s statement that Morett “did many curious works
after Holbein’s designs” has no foundation
in fact. Hollar’s engraving<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c020'><b>[144]</b></a> simply calls the subject “Mr. Morett,”
though Parthey, in a second edition of his book, cites a second state
of the engraving, sold in 1844, with the added words, “Jeweller to
Henry VIII”; no one, however, has so far succeeded in discovering
a proof of this state, and, in all probability, these words were merely
written on this particular proof by someone who had noted the reference
to Morett in the <i>Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII</i>, published
by Nicolas in 1827. This, no doubt, was the source of the legend,

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF MORETTE</div>
<p class='c023'>It remained for a Swedish critic, M. S. Larpent, finally to re-establish
the identity of the sitter as that Count of Moretta mentioned in
Wake’s letter in the seventeenth century. In a pamphlet published
in Christiania in 1881, <i>Sur le Portrait de Morett</i>, he proved conclusively
that the Dresden picture represents Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette.
M. Larpent drew attention to the fact that the drawing for the head
was once in the possession of Richardson, the painter, and that at his
sale in 1746 it was included in his catalogue as “One Holbein, sieur de
Moret, one of the French hostages in England,” this, no doubt, being
the traditional title which had remained with the drawing since it
was in the Arundel collection. It has been suggested that Hollar’s
engraving was done neither from the Dresden picture nor from the
drawing, as it shows considerable differences in the dress and details,
and is circular in shape, while the inscription is “Holbein pinxit”
not “delineavit,” indicating that it was done from a painting and not
a drawing, and thus proving that the Earl of Arundel possessed another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>portrait of Morette, which has disappeared. In this connection Sir
Sidney Colvin draws attention to the print by Hollar of an unknown
man after a painting by Holbein formerly in the Earl of Arundel’s
collection, which he thinks represents Jean de Dinteville.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c020'><b>[145]</b></a> “Now,
this print of Hollar’s,” he says, “is an exact companion to his other
print from the ‘Mr. Morett’ in the Arundel collection. Both are
small rounds, apparently taken from paintings of almost miniature
size, such as Holbein is in several instances known to have made of
persons who had also sat to him for full-sized portraits. I conclude
that he had painted two such companion miniatures, besides his larger
pictures, of the two successive French envoys, Dinteville and Morette,
and that both came into the possession of the Earl of Arundel.”<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c020'><b>[146]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f145'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r145'>145</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is the print, already mentioned (see p. 44), in
connection with the fine Windsor drawing to which Miss Hervey first
drew attention as a possible likeness of Dinteville.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f146'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r146'>146</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a letter to <i>The Times</i>, 11th September 1890.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The identity of the sitter was established beyond all possibility
of doubt in 1903 by the late Mr. Max Rosenheim’s discovery of a fine
contemporary medallion portrait of the same personage, carved in boxwood,
with his name and titles in full, and on the back his device of a
seaport, a horse, and a dolphin.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c020'><b>[147]</b></a> Charles de Solier was born in 1480,
and was fifty-four years old when resident ambassador in England
in 1534, the year in which Holbein painted him. He represented
him life-size and half-length, standing facing the spectator, dressed
in a doublet of black satin, the sleeves of which, from the elbow downwards,
are slashed with white silk. His surcoat is of the same black
material, with a heavy collar and lining of fur. Both dress and black
cap are decorated with gold tags, and in the latter he wears a circular
gold enseigne with a figure of Fortune. Round his neck hangs a gold
chain to which is suspended a medallion or watch-case of open-work.
In his right hand he holds a glove, and his left, which is gloved, grasps
the gilt and elaborately chased sheath of a dagger, suspended from his
girdle by a chain with a large tassel, such as the one worn by Dinteville.
His long beard of a reddish colour is touched here and there
with grey. The background consists of a curtain of green damask.
It is about 3 ft. 1 in. high by 2 ft. 6½ in. wide.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f147'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r147'>147</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, vol. ii., August 1903, p.
369. The medallion is in the Salting Collection, and the costume is
the same as in the picture. The inscription runs: “<span class='sc'>Carolvs · de ·
Solario · Dns · Morety · Anno · Agens · L.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Holbein’s art, both in the subtle insight it displays into character
and in its technical achievement, is seen in its highest manifestation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>in this superb and nobly-dignified portrait, which bears the stamp of
truth in every touch. The handling is both brilliant and delicate in
all the accessories, in the fine modelling of the flesh, and in the wonderful
draughtsmanship of the right hand grasping the glove. As a likeness
of a living man and as an expression of the most intimate traits
of his character, it holds its own with any piece of portraiture in the
world, and is, indeed, complete in every respect, displaying the finest
taste in conception combined with consummate skill and unerring
accuracy in execution, and most harmonious colour. The original
study for it, which, no doubt, once formed a part of the Windsor collection,
and now hangs by the side of the picture in Dresden, is
unsurpassed for its truth and force, and the subtlety with which the
likeness is expressed by the simplest means, eye and hand acting in
perfect accord and allowing nothing essential to escape them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>ROUNDELS OF ENGLISHMAN AND WIFE</div>
<p class='c023'>The two small roundels, about six inches in diameter, portraits of
a man, probably an Englishman, and his wife, in the Vienna Gallery<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c020'><b>[148]</b></a>
(Nos. 1482, 1484), formerly in the Schloss Ambras collection, are dated
1534. They are fine works, almost in miniature, though they do not
show Holbein at his highest point of achievement. The man, who has
a dark-brown beard, wears a black cap and a scarlet surcoat on which
the letters H. &amp; R. are embroidered in black and gold, indicating
that he was in the service of Henry VIII. Across the background
is inscribed: “<span class='fss'>ETATIS SVÆ 30. ANNO 1534.</span>” The woman, of a very
homely type of face, is wearing a dark-brown and black dress, and a
white head-dress, which hides her hair and falls on her shoulders in
the form of a cape. This head-dress is identical with the one worn
by the unknown lady in the Windsor collection (Holmes No. 10),
which Sir Richard Holmes thought might be a portrait of “Mother
Jack,” nurse to Edward VI. It is inscribed: “<span class='fss'>ETATIS SVÆ 28. ANNO
1534.</span>” Both portraits have now a very dark blue-green background
with a small circular ring of gold round the outer edge. The two are
evidently husband and wife, and the latter has more the appearance
of a German than an Englishwoman. It may be suggested, therefore,
though with diffidence, that it is not impossible that these two small
portraits represent Susanna Hornebolt and her husband, John
Parker, the King’s bowman and a yeoman of the robes. Dürer speaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of Susanna as being “about eighteen” in 1521, which does not quite
tally with the age of the sitter in the Vienna roundel, who was twenty-eight
in 1834, but it is again not impossible that Dürer imagined the
young lady to be two or three years older than she was in reality.
Dr. Ganz draws attention to the close likeness between this portrait
and the one of an unknown man, also a small roundel, in the possession
of Herr F. Engel-Gros, at Château de Ripaille near Thonon,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c020'><b>[149]</b></a> which he
reproduces for the first time. The sitter is clean-shaven, facing three-quarters
to the right, with a small flat red cap, elaborate black and white
Spanish work on his shirt collar, and a red livery coat, lined with blue,
with black bands and the initials “H. R.” embroidered on it. He
considers him to be either a Netherlander or a German, and suggests
that he was possibly a painter in Henry VIII’s service. It may be
permitted to go a step further and to suggest that we have here a portrait
of Susanna’s brother, Lucas Hornebolt. It was first exhibited
in Basel in 1891, and nothing of its earlier history is known. It bears
no signature or date, but is evidently of the same period as the two
Vienna roundels. There is an excellent old copy on copper of this
roundel in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (No. 537),<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c020'><b>[150]</b></a> in which,
however, the cap and coat are black, while no trace of the royal
initials on the latter can be discerned.</p>

<p class='c023'>Among the Windsor drawings there are three, two of them very
fine, which represent members of the Poyns or Poyntz family—John
Poyns,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c020'><b>[151]</b></a> of North Wokendon, Essex, a member of the royal household
and one of Wyat’s most intimate friends, in which the face is almost
in profile to the right, with the eyes turned upwards, and a small round
black cap which only covers the hair in part; and two of Nicholas
Poyntz, of the Gloucestershire branch of the family.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c020'><b>[152]</b></a> Both are inscribed
“N. Poines Knight,” and they are generally regarded as portraits
of a father and son, and are described as Sir Nicholas Poyntz
the Elder, and Sir Nicholas Poyntz the Younger. In the one he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>represented almost full-face, with beard and bare head, a free drawing
without the black lines, and somewhat rubbed. The other is a small
head in profile to the left, with a short beard and moustache, wearing
a round cap with white feather, and a gold chain on his shoulders.
There seems to be no great difference between the ages of the two, and
as Nicholas Poyntz’s father was named Anthony, probably the inscription
on the first-named drawing is incorrect, and the sitter is not
a member of this family. There are various portraits based upon the
second drawing, all apparently contemporary copies of a lost original.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c020'><b>[153]</b></a>
One of them was lent by the Marquis of Bristol to the Tudor Exhibition,
1890 (No. 79). It is a life-size portrait, half-length, in a black
dress, on panel, 24 × 17 in. Another is described by Woltmann, who
saw it in the possession of the Marquis de la Rosière in Paris.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c020'><b>[154]</b></a> It was
photographed by Braun, but since then has disappeared. It agrees
with the drawing and Lord Bristol’s picture. Both are inscribed on
the right-hand side of the blue background:—“<span class='fss'>ETATIS SVÆ 25.
ANNO 1535</span>,” and above, a three-lined French motto—“<span class='fss'>IE OBAIS
A QVI IE DOIS. IE SERS A QVI ME PLAIST. ET SVIS A QVI ME
MERITE</span>.” Woltmann regarded the Paris example as a fine and
genuine work by Holbein,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c020'><b>[155]</b></a> but it is only an old copy. There is another
in the possession of Lord Spencer at Althorp. Wornum notes a miniature
on vellum, with a plain blue background, then in the possession
of Mr. R. S. Holford, of Dorchester House, which corresponds with the
Windsor drawing.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c020'><b>[156]</b></a> Sir Nicholas Poyntz was the eldest son of Anthony
Poyntz, of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, and Elizabeth, daughter and
heir of William Hudson, of Devonshire. He does not appear to have
held any office in connection with the Court. He married Joan,
daughter of Thomas, Lord Berkeley, and died in 1557.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF NICOLAS BOURBON</div>
<p class='c023'>Another portrait painted by Holbein in 1535 was that of the French
poet, Nicolas Bourbon de Vandœuvre, who was in England during
that year. Bourbon was court-poet to Francis I, but eventually fell
into disgrace owing to certain passages in his poems. In 1534 he was
thrown into prison, from which he was finally released through the
intervention of Henry VIII, whose interest in him had been aroused
both by Anne Boleyn, who had made his acquaintance during her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>residence at the French Court in her younger days, and also by Henry’s
physician, Dr. Butts. To show his gratitude he came over to England
in 1535, and found plenty of employment in court circles as an instructor
of youth. He returned to France in 1536, leaving many friends behind
him. While in London he appears to have lodged with Cornelis
Hayes, one of the chief goldsmiths employed by the King. Among
his more intimate friends were Kratzer and Holbein, as may be gathered
from a letter which he wrote after his return to France to Thomas
Solimar, the King’s secretary, in which he says:—“I have yet to beg
you to greet in my name as heartily as you can all with whom you know
me connected by intercourse and friendship: Mr. Thomas Cranmer,
the Archbishop of Canterbury ... Mr. Cornelius Heyss, my host,
the King’s goldsmith; Mr. Nicolaus Kratzer, the King’s astronomer,
a man who is brimful of wit, jest, and humorous fancies; and Mr.
Hans, the royal painter, the Apelles of our time. I wish them from my
heart all joy and happiness!”<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c020'><b>[157]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f157'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r157'>157</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Quoted by Woltmann, i. p. 404.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Bourbon held Holbein’s art in the greatest admiration, and more
than one reference to it, couched in terms of high praise, appears in
his printed works. The original study for the portrait Holbein painted
of him is among the Windsor drawings,<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c020'><b>[158]</b></a> but the picture itself has disappeared.
In the sketch he is represented turned to the left, with a
pen in his hand, as though in the act of composing. He has a small
beard, and wears a black cap over his long hair, and looks thoughtfully
in front of him, the right arm and hand being only roughly indicated.
It is inscribed “Nicholas Borbonius Poeta,” and is a fine drawing,
in excellent condition, but some doubts have been expressed as to
whether it really represents the poet. Bourbon was delighted with the
portrait Holbein painted of him, and sings its praises in an epigram on
the “incomparable painter” Hans Holbein, which he published in his
<i>Nugae</i>. It runs:</p>

<p class='c025'>(“While the divine genius of Hans immortalises my features, tracing

verse; Hans, thus painting me, was greater than Apelles.”)</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Holbein made a smaller drawing of the portrait, which was produced
as a woodcut for the 1538 edition of Bourbon’s poems, the
<i>Nugae</i>. In this also the poet is engaged in writing, but the position
is reversed. It is inscribed “Nic. Borbonius Vandop. Anno
Aetatis xxxii. 1535.” The portrait is circular, within a square,
the corners being filled in with Renaissance ornament, and below two
naked boys supporting a shield with Bourbon’s coat of arms, a swan
surmounted by a cross. On the last page is printed the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

      <div class='line in2'>O homo: noto Deus pectora solus habet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Both his friendship for Holbein and his admiration for his art find
expression in a further poem or epigram printed in the <i>Nugae</i>,
headed “In picturam Hansi regii apud Britannos pictoris et amici.”
The verses describe a miniature painting by Holbein:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

      <div class='line'>“Sopitum in tabula puerum meus Hansus eburna</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>(My Hans has painted on an ivory panel a slumbering boy, looking like a reposing
Cupid; I see him, I am astonished, I regard him as Charintus, whom my heart loves most
warmly; I approach burning with passion, yet as I kiss him, it is only a semblance.)</p>

<p class='c027'>All traces of this miniature, which Bourbon extols so highly, have
disappeared. Two other laudatory references to Holbein occur in
the <i>Nugae</i>. In the 1538 edition, which was published in Lyon in
the same year as the “Dance of Death” cuts and the Old Testament
illustrations, the following lines have reference to the former designs:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>NICOLAS BOURBON AND HOLBEIN</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>These verses read as though they were written to accompany the
first edition of the “Dance of Death” woodcuts, but for some reason
were never used. They are interesting, too, as containing the only
contemporary reference to Holbein as the actual designer of the series.
In the same edition occur the following lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Videre qui vult Parrhasium cum Zeuxide,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>which may be paraphrased as—“Whoever wishes to see the painter
equal to Parrhasius or Zeuxis must call Hans Holbein from England
and Georgius Reperdius from the French town of Lyon.” Reperdius
was the Italian engraver Reverdino, about whom little is known,
except that much of his engraved work was after Primaticcio. The
latter was working at Fontainebleau at this period, and, if Bourbon is
to be believed, Reperdius was settled in Lyon, where the poet probably
met him when visiting that town for the purpose of making
arrangements for the republishing of his <i>Nugae</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'>For the second edition of the “Old Testament” illustrations,
published in 1539, Bourbon furnished, as already noted,<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c020'><b>[159]</b></a> a Latin poem
in which Holbein, as the designer of the woodcuts, is compared with

Zeuxis and Parrhasius appear:</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Vol. II., Plate 13</span><br />TITLE-PAGE OF COVERDALE’S BIBLE<br />1535<br /><i>From a copy in the British Museum</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>No other portrait by Holbein can be definitely attributed to the
year 1535. It was in this year that he lost two of his first English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>patrons, and both on the scaffold—Sir Thomas More and Bishop
Fisher, and his distress must have been keen, more particularly over
the death of the former, who had done so much for him when he first
arrived in London, a practically unknown foreign painter, with no
knowledge of the English language. One other work of his, however,
the design for the title-page of Coverdale’s Bible, in the publication of
which Thomas Cromwell was greatly interested, was issued in this
year, and possibly it was he who placed the commission in Holbein’s
hands. It is interesting to note that Holbein, who illustrated the
first translations of the Bible into German in Switzerland, also supplied
a design for its first complete rendering into English, which was published
under the title of “Biblia. The Bible, that is, the holy Scripture
of the Olde and New Testament, faithfully and truly translated out
of Douche and Latyn in to Englishe, <span class='fss'>M.D.XXV.</span>” This fine folio was
printed in Zürich by Froschover, and no doubt Holbein’s title-page<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c020'><b>[160]</b></a>
(<a href='#pl-13'>Pl. 13</a>) was also cut abroad, for there was no one in England at
that time capable of producing so excellent an engraving. The design
is divided into six little pictures which surround the title. The one
across the top contains the Fall and the Redemption; on the left
Adam and Eve stand under the Tree, and on the right Christ rises
from the tomb, triumphant over Death and Hell. On the left-hand
side of the page Moses is shown on Mount Sinai receiving the Tables of
the Law, and beneath him is a representation of Ezra reading the
Old Law to the Jews on their return from the Captivity. On the
opposite side, in the upper picture, Christ is sending forth His disciples
into the world to preach the gospel, and in the lower Paul is seen
preaching. In the panel across the bottom of the page Henry VIII
is seated on his throne under a canopy, with a sword of state in one
hand and a Bible in the other, which he presents to the high dignitaries
of the Church and the nobles of his Court, who kneel below him. On
either side within arched niches are the figures of King David playing
the harp, and the Apostle Paul. The King is represented with a beard,
which became the fashion in the year Coverdale’s Bible was published,
but in facial likeness there is little resemblance to Henry, due, possibly,
to the fact that the block was cut in Switzerland. The design, as a
whole, is a particularly fine and effective one, and has not suffered
to any great extent from the cutting, which is good, though not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the handiwork of a Lützelburger. Certain of the figures are of great
beauty, in particular those of the risen Christ, the Adam and Eve,
and the Paul. The resemblance, in facial type and movements,
between the figure of the Saviour sending forth His disciples to
preach and the Christ in the “Noli me Tangere” picture at
Hampton Court, has been already noted.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c020'><b>[161]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The few designs which Holbein made for woodcuts while in England
appear to have been all done at about this time, when the abuses of
the Church were being attacked most severely and the monasteries
were being swept away; though some of them were not actually published
until some years later. In them Holbein, just as he had done
in his woodcuts produced in Basel, in no way attempts to disguise his
adherence to the reformed religion. This feeling was shown very
strongly in a series of twenty-two small satirical drawings of the
Passion which appear to have been preserved in a little book, now
unfortunately lost. At one time it was in the possession of the Earl
of Arundel, and was shown by him to Sandrart as a work of Holbein’s.
The latter mentions it in his <i>Teutsche Akademie</i>, stating that each sheet
was full of little figures of every kind, that of the Redeemer always
appearing under the form of a monk attired in black. Sixteen of these
designs were engraved in the seventeenth century, no doubt while in
the Arundel collection, and most probably by Hollar, though they are
unsigned and have not the customary “Ex Collec. Arundell:” beneath
them. In them “the enemies of Christ are represented in the dress
of monks and friars, and instead of weapons they bear croziers, large
candlesticks, and other church ornaments; Judas appears as a capucin,
Annas as a cardinal, and Caiaphas as a bishop. In the subject of
Christ’s Descent to Hades the gates are hung with papal bulls and
dispensations; above them are the Pope’s arms, and the devil as keeper
of the gate wears a triple crown.”<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c020'><b>[162]</b></a></p>

<i>Anecdotes</i>, ed. Wornum, i. p. 98.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Woltmann describes a second title-page, very finely cut, which he
considers to have been produced during Holbein’s sojourn in England.
So far it has not been discovered in any published book, but there is
a fine proof of it in the Munich Print Room. On either side stand St.
Peter and St. Paul, the latter pointing upwards, two tall slender figures.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>They appear as pillars of the church, and are represented as supporting
the blank title itself, which is in the form of a paper scroll. In an arch
above is Christ risen from the Tomb, trampling upon Death and Satan,
and below are the arms of Henry VIII supported by two heraldic
beasts.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c020'><b>[163]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Something of the same satirical feeling shown in the lost drawings
of the Passion is to be seen in two or three small woodcuts of this period,
which, from the inferiority of the cutting, were very probably produced
in England. Two of them appeared among the twenty-six
little cuts in <i>Cranmer’s Catechism</i>, a small octavo volume published
in 1548, the full title being, “Catechismus, that is to say, a shorte
instruction into Christian religion for the singular commoditie and profyte
of childrē and yong people. Set forth by the mooste reverende
father in God, Thomas Archbyshop of Canterbury, primate of all
Englande and Metropolitane.—Gualterus Lynne excudebat, 1548.”
The first of Holbein’s two small pictures (folio CL) represents the parable
of the Pharisee and the Publican,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c020'><b>[164]</b></a> the scene taking place in a
church, with the Pharisee as a monk, kneeling at an altar, whom Christ
points out to His disciples, while the Publican stands with head bent
in front of them. On the edge of a book on the altar steps are the
initials “H. H.” The subject of the second cut (folio CCI) is Christ
casting out the Devil from the possessed man,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c020'><b>[165]</b></a> which, in spite of the
unsatisfactory cutting, is very dramatic and retains much of the
beauty and individuality of Holbein’s design. The Pharisees and
others who stand behind are represented as bishops, monks and
priests. It is signed in full “<span class='fss'>HANS HOLBEN</span>.” A third woodcut, very
similar to these, but still more feeble in execution, represents Christ
as the Good Shepherd,<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c020'><b>[166]</b></a> surrounded by His disciples, and pointing to
the “hired servant,” here again dressed as a monk, who is flying
before the wolf which scatters his frightened flock. This also is
signed in full “<span class='fss'>HANS HOLBEIN</span>.” It appears in a small English
pamphlet, “A lytle treatise after the manner of an Epystle,
wryten by the famous clerk Doctor Vrbanus Regius,” which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>also published by Walter Lynne, in the same year, 1548, as the
Catechism.</p>

<p class='c023'>A third, and more important, publication of 1548, <i>Hall’s Chronicle</i>,
contains a large folio woodcut representing King Henry VIII in Council,<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c020'><b>[167]</b></a>
which Woltmann regarded as undoubtedly of Holbein’s design. The
scene takes place in a magnificent chamber hung with tapestries, with
the King, his legs apart in his characteristic attitude, seated on a
throne beneath a baldachin bearing his arms. He is surrounded by
his councillors, twenty-seven in number, some listening, others lost
in thought, and others again whispering among themselves. The
cutting is excellent, and was probably done in Switzerland. The
socle with the framework enclosing the inscription “King Henry
the eyght,” and the two supporting sirens, are almost identical with
the socle and supports in the beautiful woodcut of Erasmus with the
figure of Terminus already described. These, with the small portraits
of Wyat and Bourbon, and the “Charitas” device for Reinhold
Wolfe, constitute almost the whole of Holbein’s work as a book-illustrator
while in England.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF SIR THOMAS WYAT</div>
<p class='c023'>There are several undated portraits and studies for portraits which
must have been produced between the years 1535 and 1537, among
them the likeness of Sir Thomas Wyat, the famous poet and courtier,
whose father, Sir Henry Wyat, had been painted by Holbein during
his first English visit. Wyat was about the Court during the period
under discussion; a few years later he was often absent from England
on foreign embassies. There is a study for his portrait among the
Windsor drawings (<a href='#pl-14'>Pl. 14</a>)<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c020'><b>[168]</b></a> which is one of the finest in the collection,
though considerably rubbed and stained, and also a good, possibly contemporary,
copy.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c020'><b>[169]</b></a> He is represented nearly full-face, wearing a cap,
and with a long flowing beard, both hair and beard being modelled
with the brush. The portrait which must have been painted from this
singularly attractive study is not now known to exist; a small painting
in oils corresponding to the drawing, but not by Holbein, was exhibited
by Mr. Bruce at the National Portrait Exhibition in 1866. A
second portrait of Sir Thomas was drawn by Holbein at a somewhat
later date, which was reproduced as a woodcut, shortly after the poet’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>death, in the little book entitled <i>Næniæ in Mortem Thomæ Viati
Equitis Incomparabilis</i>, written by John Leland, the antiquary, in
honour of his memory, and published in 1542. The portrait,<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c020'><b>[170]</b></a> which
is a small roundel in the style of the circular portraits in wax or boxwood
which were at that time much in vogue, may have been drawn
by Holbein himself on the block. The engraving itself is somewhat
crudely done, but was, no doubt, the best that could be procured at
that time in London; yet in spite of its roughness the little portrait
is a true likeness, full of character, such as no one in England but
Holbein could have produced. Wyat is represented almost in profile
to the right, with a long beard and a high bare forehead, bearing out
Leland’s description in his panegyric that “nature had given the youth
dark auburn hair, but this gradually disappeared and left him bald,
but the thick forest of his flowing beard increased more and more.”
The neck is bare, and bounded by a slight drapery in the classical
manner, giving it the appearance of a medallion. Underneath the
woodcut, which is printed on the reverse of the title, are the following
lines in praise of both painter and poet:</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF SIR THOMAS WYAT</div>
<p class='c023'>The drawing, no doubt, was made by Holbein on purpose for the
book, but whether it was an original study from memory, or was based
on a portrait of Wyat he had painted some little time previously, is
uncertain. Several circular oil paintings exist which are either founded
upon the <i>Næniæ</i> woodcut, or are contemporary copies of a portrait
by Holbein which cannot now be traced. The latter is the more probable
supposition, as in all the paintings the head is turned to the left,
whereas in the woodcut it faces to the right, not having been reversed
when drawn on the block. One of these versions, formerly in the
collection of the Marquis of Hastings, who lent it to the National
Portrait Exhibition, 1866, is now in the National Portrait Gallery
(No. 1035);<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c020'><b>[171]</b></a> a second, apparently a copy from the former, is in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Bodleian Library at Oxford. This latter was in the Tudor Exhibition,
1890 (No. 169), the Oxford Exhibition of Historical Portraits, 1904
(No. 24), and the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition, 1909 (No. 50).
It is a bust, three-quarters to left, with dark hair, beard, and moustache,
and bald forehead, red drapery round the shoulders, and a plain
brown background; and is inscribed “<span class='fss'>SYR·THOMAS·WYAT</span>.” A smaller
circular portrait, also on an oak panel, belonging to the Countess of
Romney, showing Wyat in the same position, but dressed in the costume
of his day, with a black coat lined with white fur, is attributed to Lucas
Cornelisz.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c020'><b>[172]</b></a> It is inscribed, “Sir Thomas Wiat. B.1503. D.1541.
Lucas Cornelii,” but this is of a later period than the painting, and
the date of Wyat’s death is given wrongly. The head is in the same
position as in the <i>Næniæ</i> woodcut. On the back of this portrait was
at one time another panel, which now hangs by it in Lady Romney’s
collection, representing Wyat’s “Maze,” and painted as a record of
an amusing incident in his diplomatic mission to Italy in 1527. In
the centre of the maze is shown a falling centaur with the Pope’s triple
crown on his head. There was a portrait of a Wyat in the Arundel
collection (<i>il ritratto del Cavaglier Wyat</i>), but whether this was one of
Sir Thomas, or the one of his father, now in the Louvre, is uncertain.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>There are two very similar circular portraits in existence of Wyat’s
son, Sir Thomas Wyat, the younger, which bear so strong a likeness to
the portraits of his father that at first sight they appear to have been
painted from the same original. One of them was lent to the Burlington
Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 48), by the Rt. Hon. Lewis Fry, and the
other belongs to Lady Romney.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c020'><b>[173]</b></a> He is shown in profile, to the left,
looking upwards, the neck cut off at the beginning of the shoulders, as in
the portraits of his father, and wearing a slight, light brown moustache,
pointed beard, and short hair. Lady Romney’s version is of the same
size as the Cornelisz portrait, while Mr. Fry’s more nearly approaches
that of the National Portrait Gallery and Oxford portraits of his father.
Mr. Fry’s panel was once in the collection of Charles I, having his
brand on the back, and it is possibly the portrait which was in the
possession of John, Lord Lumley, in 1590. The “classical” treatment
followed in the cutting short of the bare neck has led to the erroneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>supposition that the portrait has reference to Wyat’s decapitation in
1554 for rebellion against Queen Mary. It is possible that these
portraits of the younger Wyat are based on a lost original by Holbein.
He was born in 1521, so that he would have been twenty-two at the
time of Holbein’s death. Mr. Roger E. Fry sees in Mr. Lewis Fry’s
version a predominant Flemish influence. “It remains,” he says,
“one of the most inscrutable riddles of the exhibition. It is a work
of such great technical excellence that its authorship ought to be discoverable.
It seems probable that it was painted in England and
from life.”<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c020'><b>[174]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The very interesting and beautiful portrait of a lady lent by Major
Charles Palmer to the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, 1907 (No. 13),
and to the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 64) (<a href='#pl-15'>Pl. 15</a>),<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c020'><b>[175]</b></a> is now
identified, with some degree of certainty, as a portrait of Sir Thomas
Wyat the elder’s sister, Margaret Wyat, Lady Lee. This identification
is based upon an enlarged version of the portrait in the possession
of Viscount Dillon at Ditchley, Oxfordshire, which, according to family
tradition, is said to represent that lady, who was the wife of Sir Anthony
Lee, and the mother of Sir Henry Lee, K.G. She is shown at three-quarters
length, three-quarters to the left. Her hair, of reddish gold,
is almost hidden by her black and white French hood decorated with
a band of pearls arranged in groups of four, alternating with small
panels of gold filigree work. Her dress is of dark-brown damask,
puffed at the shoulders, and ornamented with numerous gold tags or
points, and a rose-coloured petticoat. Her hands are clasped in front
of her, and she holds by a short ribbon a circular gold medallion on
which is a figure of Lucrece above a dark oblong stone. On her right
hand are two signet rings, one with a red and one with a dark stone.
The dress, open at the neck, shows a white collar or lining, and white
ruffles cover her wrists. A rose in red enamel is at her breast, and a
gold chain round her neck. Across the plain dark green background
is inscribed, “<span class='fss'>ETATIS·SVÆ·34</span>.” It is on panel, 16½ in. ×
12½ in. Her long, very sharp nose resembles that of her brother,
and her complexion is of a somewhat unpleasant reddish tone. The
drawing of the face, and particularly of the hands, is very delicate.
It is now in the Collection of Mr. Benjamin Altman, New York.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Opinion, so far, is divided as to whether this fine work is by Holbein
or not. The first impression received is that it is certainly not by him,
from the flatness of the modelling of the face, a certain hardness in
the execution, and the rather unpleasant red tone of the complexion;
but further examination considerably modifies this opinion. It is
difficult, if the attribution to Holbein is rejected, to suggest the name
of any other artist then practising in England, who possessed the ability
to produce a portrait as fine and as remarkable as this one is. To
Sir Martin Conway “it appears to be obviously and all over Holbein.”<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c020'><b>[176]</b></a>
Mr. Roger E. Fry says that “opinion is so divided that it would be
rash to dogmatize. The picture is in wonderful condition and is entirely
in Holbein’s manner. Indeed, it must in any case be derived
directly from a drawing by Holbein. The only question to be settled
is whether the master himself ever became so entirely the craftsman
absorbed in the technical perfection of his work to the exclusion of the
larger issues of expression; whether he could have ever so far lost his
sense of relief, treated line so entirely as a matter of edge with so little
sense of the mass it should define. Such questions can only be decided
by a gradual consensus of opinion. My own belief is that it will be
decided ultimately against Holbein’s having actually executed the
painting, though I am bound to admit no other known imitator comes
as near to Holbein himself as does the author of this.”<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c020'><b>[177]</b></a> Dr. Ganz
regards it as a genuine work by Holbein, and dates it 1540, drawing
attention to the similarity of the enamelled rose fastened to her dress
to the one worn by Lady Butts, who was painted by Holbein at about
that date.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c020'><b>[178]</b></a> It will be seen that the critics are divided; and it is certainly
by no means easy to arrive at a definite conclusion. It is interesting
to note, as a minor point, that the gold tags with which Lady
Lee’s dress is decorated are very similar to those on the surcoat of
Sir Thomas Wyat in the Lucas Cornelisz portrait, and are arranged
in much the same manner.</p>

<p class='c022'>It is on an oak panel about 19 in. high × 14 in. wide. This is one of
Holbein’s finest portraits of his second English period, and displays a
very subtle insight into what must have been an unattractive and in
many ways despicable nature. The small brown eyes have a look of
cunning, and the face with its smooth fat cheeks has few pretensions to
comeliness. Southwell was heir to great wealth, and was brought up
with Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and was intimate with the family
of the Duke of Norfolk. In 1531 he was obliged to pay a fine of £1000
before he could obtain pardon for being concerned in a murder, yet
three years later he was Sheriff of Norfolk. From 1535 onwards he
took an active share in the dissolution of the monasteries, and was
in all ways a willing and able tool of his royal master. His treachery
helped to bring Sir Thomas More to the scaffold, and, later on, he played
an even more treacherous part at the trial of his early companion, the
Earl of Surrey. He was knighted in 1542, and appointed one of the
King’s executors, and under Queen Elizabeth he became Master of
Ordnance. Something of his unsavoury character is suggested by
Holbein in his portrait, which is distinguished by its remarkable
individuality and its fine technical qualities both in the flesh painting,
more particularly in the hands and the eyes, and in all the details of
the costume. Nothing is known of the history of the picture except
that it belonged to the Earl of Arundel, who presented it to
Cosimo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1620,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c020'><b>[181]</b></a> as one of the best
Holbeins in his collection. It is still in its seventeenth-century
frame, with a silver tablet engraved with the arms of England and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the Medici, and an inscription, “Effigies domini Ricardi Southwelli

by Napoleon from Germany in 1806. Another copy was lent to the
National Portrait Exhibition at South Kensington, 1866, by Mr. H. E.
Chetwynd Stapylton. A portrait of Southwell, apparently based on
Holbein’s picture, was lent to the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 217),
by Mr. W. H. Romaine Walker. In this version Southwell’s coat of
arms and the inscription “Copley Stili” are on the right-hand side of
the background, and on the left “Richd. Southwell of Horsham St.
Faith’s in Norfolk <span class='fss'>ÆT.95</span>.” The age in this inscription is altogether
wrong, for Southwell was fifty-seven at his death in 1561.</p>

<p class='c023'>The third portrait of 1536 represents Sir Thomas le Strange. It
is on panel, 15¼ × 10½ in., and was exhibited at the Tudor Exhibition,
1890 (No. 113), and at the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition,
1909 (No. 41), lent by Mr. Hamon le Strange.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c020'><b>[184]</b></a> It is a bust portrait,
three-quarters to the left. The sitter has greyish hair cut straight
across the forehead, and a short brown beard and moustache. His
black cap has a number of gold tags and a medallion, and he wears
a gown with a brown fur collar over a black dress, a pleated white
collar from which long tags hang down, and a long gold chain over his
shoulders. Across the top, on the green-blue background, is the repainted
inscription “<span class='fss'>ANNO D<b>E</b> 1536 ÆTATIS SVÆ 43</span>.” It has suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>considerable repainting about the face, but it is a picture of much
interest, and since it was last exhibited has been acknowledged by most
of the leading critics to be a genuine work by Holbein. The original

Windsor collection.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c020'><b>[185]</b></a> Sir Thomas Strange or le Strange, of Hunstanton,

<p class='c023'>A small, undated bust portrait of Lady Vaux, wife of Thomas,
second Lord Vaux, of Harrowden, the poet, has every appearance of
belonging to this period. There are two versions of it, one in the
Prague Gallery (No. 608),<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c020'><b>[186]</b></a> and one at Hampton Court (No. 591 (337)).<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c020'><b>[187]</b></a>
Dr. Ganz regards both as old copies, but Sir Claude Phillips considers
the former to be the original work by Holbein, and A. von Zahn says
that it is indubitably original, but has suffered so severely and has
been so heavily over-painted that little of Holbein’s handiwork is left.
The Hampton Court version is the better of the two, and is apparently
an excellent copy, though in technique of a somewhat later date.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c020'><b>[188]</b></a> It
has been held, nevertheless, by most English writers to be a genuine
but badly-damaged work of Holbein. The head has been repainted,
which gives it that faded appearance noted by Mr. Wornum<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c020'><b>[189]</b></a> and Dr.
Waagen,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c020'><b>[190]</b></a> though the latter attributed it to “the attempt to give the
refinements of the modelling in grey half-tones,” in doing which
Holbein “sacrificed the warm local colours observable in his earlier
pictures.” On the other hand, many of the accessories, such as the
gold-and-enamel medallion, the chain round her neck, the ring, and the
cuffs, display a delicacy of execution not easily attributable to anyone
but Holbein. She is represented to the waist, almost full-face, the body
turned slightly to the spectator’s left, and is dressed in black, with
ermine upon the sleeves, and the customary diamond-shaped hood,
edged with pearls, and with a black fall. She wears a thin black chain
round her neck, and at her breast a circular brooch with a figure of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Virgin enthroned. Her hands rest in her lap, and in her right she holds
a pink. It is on panel, 1 ft. 3 in. high by 11¼ in. wide. Mr. Law
suggests that it is identical with “The picture of Madame de Vaux,
by Holbein,” which was among the Duke of Buckingham’s pictures
sent to be sold at Antwerp, whence it presumably returned with the
“Dutch Gift,” and may, perhaps, be identified with No. 410 in James
I’s catalogue, described as “One of King Henry VIII’s Queens, holding
a gillyflower.”<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c020'><b>[191]</b></a> There is a study for the head among the Windsor
drawings,<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c020'><b>[192]</b></a> in which the strengthening lines are exceptionally hard
and pronounced, and mar an otherwise fine drawing. Holbein also
painted her husband, though the picture has been lost, but the very
beautiful drawing for it, described in a later chapter,<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c020'><b>[193]</b></a> remains at
Windsor. There is a second study of Lord Vaux by Holbein in the
same collection.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF SIR NICHOLAS CAREW</div>
<p class='c023'>The portrait of Sir Nicholas Carew, Henry’s Master of the Horse,
was probably painted during the earlier years of Holbein’s second
residence in London. It could not have been done later than 1537,
for in 1538 Carew was thrown into prison for supposed connection
with the conspiracy of Cardinal Pole and the Marquis of Exeter, and
was beheaded on March 3rd, 1539. There is a brilliant study for this
portrait in the Basel Gallery (<a href='#pl-17'>Pl. 17</a>), a drawing in black and coloured
chalks.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c020'><b>[194]</b></a> He is wearing body armour, and has a short beard and
moustache; his hair is concealed by a close-fitting coif, and there are
an octagonal medallion and a white feather in his black cap. It is
one of the most masterly drawings Holbein ever made, searching in
its truth, and of exact and delicate draughtsmanship.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c020'><b>[195]</b></a> As it was
included among the collection of works by Holbein formed by his
friend and admirer, Bonifacius Amerbach, it may have been presented
to the latter by the artist himself when he was in Basel in 1538.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f194'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r194'>194</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, 31. Reproduced by Davies, p. 212; Ganz, <i>Hdz.
Schwz. Mstr.</i>, iii. 40, and <i>Holbein</i>, p. xxxiii. Dr. Ganz is
of the opinion that this drawing is of Holbein’s first English period,
and that the finished portrait was painted in 1527 or 1528. See
<i>Holbein</i>, p. 238.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f195'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r195'>195</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been suggested that the fine drawing of an English
lady in the same collection is a portrait of Lady Carew, but it more
probably represents Lady Guldeford. See Vol. i. p. 321.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The oil painting done from this study is in the collection of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, K.G.,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c020'><b>[196]</b></a> and was last publicly
exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909 (No. 45). It is
a three-quarters length, turned to the left as in the drawing. The
beard is brown, and the coif below the black hat is of cloth of gold.
The octagonal gold badge represents a tree stem raguly and a banderole
inscribed “<span class='fss'>SOLA</span>.” He is wearing full plate-armour, and brown
trunks slashed with cloth of gold. With his right hand he holds a
white truncheon against his hip, and with the other grasps his sword
by the scabbard. The background is a green damask curtain, and on
a small cartellino in the left-hand bottom corner is inscribed in a
cursive hand “<span class='fss'>SR NICHOLAS CAREWE, MASTER OF THE HORSE TO
KING HENRY YE 8</span>.” It is on a panel of unusual shape, being 36 in.
high by 40 in. wide. This picture, as a whole, is a fine and interesting
example of Tudor portraiture, but parts of it are certainly not
by Holbein. The head is good, but the armour and many of the
details are by some other, and possibly a later, hand. The probabilities
are that it was begun by Holbein and finished by someone
else; perhaps the arrest of Carew may have brought the completion
of the work to an abrupt conclusion as far as Holbein was concerned.
The fact that his name is given on the cartellino suggests that the
portrait may be a posthumous one. It was not the usual custom at
that time to place more than the date and the age of the person
depicted upon the panel. Except in the form of a superscription to
a letter held by the sitter, as in the Kratzer, Cromwell, and some of
the Steelyard portraits, Holbein was not in the habit of adding the
name to the pictures he painted in England. The “Duchess of Milan”
is an exception,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c020'><b>[197]</b></a> but even here there is every probability that the
cartellino was painted in at a later date. It is difficult to decide
whether the Carew portrait was begun by Holbein and finished by some
other hand, or whether it is an almost contemporary copy from some
lost original. The head follows the Basel drawing closely, but as the
latter was owned by Amerbach it is improbable that a copyist could have
made use of it; so that, taking all things into consideration, it is safer to
assume that Holbein himself had a share in its painting.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c020'><b>[198]</b></a> This portrait
was in the possession of John, Lord Lumley, in 1590, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>sold from Lumley Castle in 1785 for ten guineas. In the inventory
of 1590 it is described as “Of S<b>r</b> Nichls Carewe M<b>r</b> of the horse to
K:H:8”; and it is interesting to note that the words “drawne by
Haunce Holbyn” are not added, as they are after several other works
by the master which Lord Lumley possessed. It has been suggested
that this portrait is the “Ritratto d’homo armato” of the Arundel
inventory of 1655, but if the picture remained in the possession of the
Lumley family until 1785 this supposition cannot be correct. Symonds,
in his Note-Books, has an entry of “A Ritratto of an English knight
by Holbein who sits in a chayre and a table by him,” in the collection
of the Earl of Northumberland in Suffolk House, which seems to
refer to this picture.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c020'><b>[199]</b></a></p>

THE exact date of Holbein’s entry into the royal service
is unknown. Three records of the household expenditure
of the King are in existence: the Accounts
of Bryan Tuke, Treasurer of the Chamber, which
extend from 1st October, 20th Hen. VIII (1528) to
May, 23rd Hen. VIII (1531), during which period
Holbein was out of England; the Privy Purse Expenses of the King,
from November 1529 to December 1532; and further Accounts of
Tuke, as Treasurer, from Lady Day, 29th Hen. VIII (1538) to Midsummer,
33rd Hen. VIII (1541). Although Holbein was in England
during the latter half of 1532, his name does not occur in the Privy
Purse expenses, as it certainly would have done had he then been
in the King’s employment. Unfortunately, no accounts have been
preserved for the period between 1533 and 1537, and so it is not until
1538 that we have definite proof that the painter was in receipt of a
regular salary from the royal purse. The first entry referring to him
is at Lady Day, 1538, when the following occurs: “Item, for Hans
Holben, paynter, vii<i>li.</i> x<i>s.</i>” As his salary of £30 a
year, paid quarterly, was not as a rule paid in advance, he must have
already been in the royal service at least three months earlier, that
is in December 1537.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S ENTRY INTO ROYAL SERVICE</div>
<p class='c023'>The first actual reference to him as painter to the King is contained
in the letter of Nicolas Bourbon, already quoted, written
early in 1536, in which he speaks of him as the “royal painter,” and
it is to be inferred from it that Holbein already held that position in
1535, when the poet was in England and made his acquaintance. The
circular miniature of Jane Seymour by Hilliard in the Windsor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Collection, apparently copied from an original by Holbein, is inscribed
“<span class='sc'>Anō Dnī 1536 ætatis svæ 27</span>”; and the great painting of
Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth of York, and Jane Seymour, with
which Holbein covered one of the walls of the Privy Chamber at
Whitehall, was done in 1537. None of the earlier portraits of Henry
or of his two first queens, usually ascribed to Holbein, are authentic
works of his, which affords some proof that he did not enter the royal
service until after Jane Seymour had been crowned Queen in 1536,
or, if Bourbon is to be believed, that at least he did not do so until
towards the end of Anne Boleyn’s life. The small portrait of
Henry VIII on the frontispiece of Coverdale’s Bible, printed in 1535,
bears little real likeness to the King, and may well have been designed
by Holbein without any sitting from him; though, on the other hand,
it may also be taken as some indication that he was already the King’s
servant in that year. It is safer, however, to assume, as the evidence
for an earlier year is so scant, that he received his first pay from the
royal purse in the autumn of 1536.</p>

<p class='c023'>It is extraordinary, and indeed almost inexplicable, that Holbein
was at work for so long a time in England before he received royal
recognition. That this did not happen during his first sojourn in
London is surprising enough, but that on his return he should remain
for three or four years busily employed in painting portraits of people
about Henry’s court, some of which the King must have seen, is still
more difficult of explanation. Henry entered into keen but friendly
rivalry with Francis I in his patronage of art, and was anxious at all
times to induce good foreign artists to settle in England; and yet
here was a painter of gifts which placed him high above his fellows, who,
apparently, went quite unrecognised. This is the more remarkable
when it is remembered that the King was well acquainted with, and
had expressed his delight in, at least one work of Holbein done
during his first English visit—“The Battle of Spurs,” which decorated
the back of the arch of the temporary Banquet Hall at
Greenwich. It is hardly possible that it was owing to any disinclination
on Holbein’s own part, however anxious he may have been to
retain his rights as a citizen of Basel. He could have entered Henry’s
service for a year or two without renouncing his burghership, or
becoming a naturalised English subject, and that he did obtain the
post in the end seems to indicate that the obstacle, whatever it may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>have been, was not one of his own making. It was, on the other
hand, an honour to which he would aspire, and the possibility of
holding some such position must have been one of the reasons which
induced him to visit this country, as it was with all the foreign artists
and craftsmen who made London their temporary home. A satisfactory
explanation of this mystery is hard to find, and unless further
evidence is discovered, it must remain unsolved.</p>

<p class='c023'>That there is some possibility that Holbein was indirectly employed
by the Crown even earlier than 1535 is suggested by an interesting
memorandum dealing with goldsmiths’ work published in the
Calendars of Letters and Papers. The paper is undated, but is placed by
the editor under the year 1534. It is an account rendered to the
King’s Secretary, Thomas Cromwell, by the Dutchman Cornelis
Hayes, one of the leading foreign goldsmiths in London during Henry’s
reign, who was constantly employed by the King and the court.
The articles supplied were apparently for the royal service, the chief
among them being an elaborately decorated silver cradle, which may
possibly have been for the use of the Princess Elizabeth, who was
born on the 7th September 1533. The document runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c023'>“Parcels delivered to Mr. Secretary by me, Cornelys Hayes, goldsmith.
A silver cradle, price 16<i>li.</i> For making a silver plate,
altering the images, making the roses underneath the cradle, the roses
about the pillars, and new burnishing, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> For the
stones that were set in gold in the cradle, 15<i>s.</i>; for fringes,
the gold about the cushions, tassels, white satin, cloth of gold,
lining, sypars, and swadyl-bands, 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Total,

gilding of the foot and setting of the currall (coral), 33<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> To Hance, painter, for painting the same Adam and Eve,
20<i>s.</i>”<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c020'><b>[200]</b></a> Other items are included in the account which need not
be quoted.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The “Hance, painter,” who supplied this picture of “Adam and
Eve,” was undoubtedly Holbein, who was acquainted with Hayes,
as we learn from Bourbon’s letter, and for whom he almost certainly
provided designs for jewellery.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c020'><b>[201]</b></a> The document is not very clear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and on a first reading it would appear that the “Adam and Eve”
formed part of the decoration of the cradle; but it is more probable
that it had nothing to do with it, but was a separate piece of work,
either a picture or a carving in wood, honestone, or alabaster, which
Holbein was employed to colour; possibly the latter, as the fee paid,
twenty shillings, was a small one for an original painting from his
brush. Whether picture or carving, it was evidently set in a very
elaborate silver frame, decorated with silver apples in relief, as appropriate
to the subject it contained, and with coral inset. No trace
of this work remains, but the possibility that Holbein’s share in it was
a small picture recalls that earlier “Adam and Eve” of the first Basel
years, which, as already noted,<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c020'><b>[202]</b></a> bears a considerable resemblance to
the heads in the picture of the same subject by Mabuse in Hampton
Court.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f201'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r201'>201</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The same paper contains an item for “the garnishing of
two books with silver-gilt, 66 oz. at 6<i>s.</i>,” which recalls
Holbein’s designs in the British Museum for work of a similar kind.

London mercer, at a cost of 43<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAITS OF HENRY VIII</div>
<p class='c023'>Among the numerous portraits of Henry VIII to be met with in
so many of the great houses of this country and in several European
museums, which, in almost all cases, are attributed by their owners
to Holbein, only three<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c020'><b>[203]</b></a> can be ascribed to him with any certainty.
These are the large cartoon for the left-hand half of the Whitehall
wall-painting, belonging to the Duke of Devonshire; the beautiful
little panel portrait in Earl Spencer’s collection at Althorp; and the
crayon study in the Munich Gallery. The greater number of the
remaining portraits of him, most of them based on the Whitehall
likeness, are merely inferior copies, and copies of copies, “shop”
pieces supplied to order by Henry’s painters for presentation to foreign
potentates and ambassadors, and to his own statesmen and courtiers
as a reward for faithful service. Less frequently one is met with which
is a good and original work by some painter of lower rank than Holbein,
and such portraits, in their turn, have been multiplied by assistants in
order to meet the constant demand for the King’s likeness.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f203'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r203'>203</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A fourth work, the portrait in the National Gallery,
Rome, is, however, considered by Dr. Ganz and other critics to be an
original work by Holbein.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The great Whitehall fresco was painted in 1537, and was the
first work of importance which Holbein undertook for the Crown.
It achieved immense popularity, and for one hundred and fifty years
or so every foreign visitor of distinction was taken to see it, while all
artists who had an opportunity of examining it spoke loudly in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>praises. It covered one of the walls in the Privy Chamber at Whitehall,
and was painted on either side and over the top of a window, or,
more probably, the fireplace, and consisted of four great figures,
Henry VIII and his father, Henry VII, on one side, and his mother,
Elizabeth of York, and his third wife, Jane Seymour, on the other,
arranged within an elaborately designed architectural setting. This
great work, which added so much to Holbein’s fame among his contemporaries,
was destroyed in the fire at Whitehall in January 1698;
but happily, owing to the foresight of Charles II, we still possess, in
the small copy of it by the Flemish artist Remigius van Leemput,
in Hampton Court<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c020'><b>[204]</b></a> (No. 601 (308)), a very valuable record of the
composition of the work. The copy is evidently a very faithful one,
and though, of course, it lacks all the greatness of style, the vividness
of character, and the beauty of colour of the original—for Remée was
a poor artist—it reproduces the composition with some exactitude, and
so is invaluable to students of the master. This copy was made by
Van Leemput in 1667, the probable reason being that the fresco was
then beginning to show signs of decay, and that Charles was anxious
to retain an accurate record of it before it was ruined. Patin, who
visited England about 1670, and saw both the painting and the copy,
said that the latter was ordered by the King “pour en estendre la
posterité s’il faut ainsi dire, et n’abandonner pas une si belle chose à
la fortune des temps.”<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c020'><b>[205]</b></a> Walpole says that Remée, as he was familiarly
called here, received £150 for his work,<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c020'><b>[206]</b></a> which was a very large fee for
those days, and shows how highly the King valued the original.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE WHITEHALL WALL-PAINTING</div>
<p class='c023'>The wall-painting itself was still in perfect condition when Van
Mander saw it in 1604. He was deeply impressed by this “over-heerlijk
Portret” of Henry, which, he wrote, was so true to life that it
filled the spectator with dismay.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c020'><b>[207]</b></a> “The King, as he stood there,
majestic in his splendour, was so life-like, that the spectator felt
abashed, annihilated, in his presence.” Earlier travellers who saw it
and praised it were Johann Fischart, in 1576,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c020'><b>[208]</b></a> and Hentzner, who
visited England in 1598; while Duke Johann Ernst of Saxony, who
was here in 1613, was also taken to see it; it is noted in the records
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of his journey, “upon this his Royal Highness was conducted into
the King’s apartment; it was small but hung with beautiful tapestries
on all sides. In this room were the full-length portraits of Henrici
VIII, and his father, Henrici VII. They were regarded as special
works of art, and similar works are said not to be seen throughout
England.” Both Pepys and Evelyn mention it in their diaries. The
latter, under the date 11th February 1656, says he was glad to find,
on revisiting Whitehall for the first time for many years, that “they
had not much defac’d that rare piece of Hen. VII, &amp;c., don on the
walles of the King’s privy chamber.” This entry proves that ten or
eleven years before Charles II ordered the copy to be made the
fresco was beginning to show signs of decay. It narrowly escaped destruction
in the earlier fire at Whitehall in 1691, but the conflagration
of 1698 was a much more serious one. It burnt down the entire Palace,
with the exception of the Banqueting House and a few buildings adjoining
it. More than a thousand apartments perished in the flames,
and a number of pictures in the Matted Gallery and elsewhere, mentioned
by Evelyn, were destroyed. “This terrible conflagration,
which broke out about four in the afternoon and lasted upwards of
seventeen hours, originated through the neglect and carelessness of a
laundress, a Dutch woman, who had left some linen to dry in front of
a fire, in the lodging of a certain Colonel Stanley. She and twelve
other persons, so it is reported, perished in the flames.”<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c020'><b>[209]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>By the aid of the large cartoon and Van Leemput’s copy a very
good idea of the general effect and composition of the picture can be
obtained. It is divided into two stages. On the spectator’s left
hand stands Henry VIII, turned fully to the front, with arms akimbo,
and legs stretched widely apart, and opposite him, on the other side
of the picture, is Jane Seymour. Behind and above the King, and to
the right of him, on a raised step or low platform, stands his father,
Henry VII, and in a corresponding position on the other side, his
mother, Elizabeth of York. Henry was very proud of his legs, and
Holbein has depicted him in his favourite attitude. He holds a glove
in his right hand, and with the left the cord of his dagger, gold hilted,
with a gold and blue velvet sheath. His gold-brown doublet is richly
jewelled, and his red surcoat is trimmed with fur and elaborately
brocaded with gold thread; a heavy jewelled chain crosses his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>shoulders, and from another hangs a pendant. His flat black bonnet
is ornamented with pearls, devices in gold, and white feathers. The
figure is rather larger than life-size, but looks colossal. His shoulders
appear enormous, partly owing to the dress, and partly, no doubt,
through some exaggeration on the artist’s part to flatter the vanity
of his royal sitter. Henry VII is shown in simpler costume; with his
right hand he holds together the folds of his long ermine-trimmed gown,
his left elbow resting on the marble pedestal which Van Leemput
has placed in the centre in lieu of the window or chimney-piece which
occupied the same position in the wall itself. He holds his gloves in
his left hand, and has the Garter collar across his breast. Unlike his
son, he is beardless, and his long hair falls to his shoulders. Jane
Seymour is wearing a dress of tawny gold, full ermine sleeves, and
several necklaces of pearls. Her hands are clasped in front of her,
and a small white dog is lying on the long skirt of her gown. Behind
her, Elizabeth of York stands with her arms crossed, and holding up
her dress with her right hand. The floor is covered with a Turkey
carpet, and the background consists of richly-decorated pilasters and
capitals, niches, and a frieze, in various coloured marbles, in the
Renaissance style of which Holbein made such brilliant use. In the
frieze on either side are figures supporting a shield. The shield shown
in the cartoon bears the initials H and J; the other, no doubt, gave
the date. In Van Leemput’s copy the initials have been changed to
“AN<b>o</b>. Dō.” with “1537” in the corresponding
panel, while the centre of the picture is filled with a high marble
pedestal, with two cushions
on the top, and on the front of it a long Latin inscription in praise of
the two monarchs. Below this is inscribed: “Prototypvm Magnitvdinis
Ipso Opere Tectorio Fecit Holbenivs Ivbente Henrico VIII,”
and a little below, on a plinth: “Ectypvm A Remigio Van Leempvt
Breviora Tabella Describi Volvit Carolus II. M.B.F.E.H.R. A°.

<div class='sidenote'>CARTOON OF HENRY VII &amp; HENRY VIII</div>
<p class='c023'>Van Leemput’s inferiority as an artist is shown most clearly in
his rendering of the faces. In that of Henry VIII, in particular, the
drawing is weak and lacking in character, and as a likeness it bears no
close resemblance to the many portraits still existing which were
copied or adapted from the fresco. It must be regarded, therefore,
as a not very reliable record of the facial appearance of the four sitters
as Holbein painted them.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The pedestal was, no doubt, Van Leemput’s own invention, and
the Latin verses must have been specially written for the purpose of
his copy. As already pointed out, the wall on which the fresco was
painted contained either a window or a fireplace. Charles Patin
describes it as “sur le pignon de la croisée”; but it has been suggested
that “croisée” is a typographical error for “cheminée.” Patin,
however, was not a very careful observer, for he speaks of the subject
as “de la main d’Holbein, le portrait d’Henry huit et des Princes
ses enfants.”<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c020'><b>[210]</b></a> In this, nevertheless, he may not be so completely
wrong as at first sight appears. In 1897 Mr. Ernest Law, the historian
of Hampton Court Palace, discovered another copy of the great wall-painting,
also by Van Leemput, and of the same size and scale as the
Hampton Court example, but with one important difference. In
the middle foreground the copyist has placed a standing figure of
Edward VI. This interesting little picture belongs to Lord Leconfield,
and is in one of the private bedrooms at Petworth, Sussex. Patin
may have seen this copy, and afterwards may have confused it with
the wall-painting; or again, he may have confused the fresco with
the picture of Henry VIII and his family, by an unknown artist of the
school of Holbein, now in Hampton Court, No. 340 (510), but probably
in Patin’s day hanging in Whitehall.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c020'><b>[211]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f211'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r211'>211</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is hardly possible that the figure of Edward VI was
added to the wall-painting itself after the death of Holbein, or
otherwise it would appear in both Van Leemput’s copies. It was, no
doubt, taken from some independent portrait of the young king then
hanging in Whitehall.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The life-size cartoon of Henry VIII and his father, belonging to the
Duke of Devonshire, until recently at Hardwick Hall (<a href='#pl-18'>Pl. 18</a>),<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c020'><b>[212]</b></a> is, though
only a working drawing, a superb example of Holbein’s mastery of
composition on a monumental scale. It is the original design for the
left-hand part of the Whitehall fresco, and along its outlines the
prickings are still visible by means of which the design was pounced
on the wall. It provides evidence that Van Leemput’s copy was a
faithful one, for, with one important exception, the two agree in all
points. The exception is in the position of the King’s head. In the
cartoon it is about three-quarters to the right, but in the copy it has
been turned so that the monarch is looking directly at the spectator.
Woltmann is, no doubt, right when he suggests that the change was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>made by the express wish of Henry himself while the wall-painting
was in progress.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c020'><b>[213]</b></a> He desired to be shown full-fronted to the world,
for he was proud of his appearance, more particularly of his calves, as
more than one contemporary anecdote shows. In his younger days,
at the beginning of his reign, he was the most commanding figure at
the English court, praised by all for his good looks, and celebrated for
his great bodily strength and for his proficiency in all manly sports and
exercises. He is thus described by the Venetian ambassador Pasqualigo
in 1515; “His Majesty is the handsomest potentate I ever
set eyes on; above the usual height, with an extremely fine calf to
his leg; his complexion very fair and bright, with auburn hair combed
straight and short in the French fashion; and a round face so very
beautiful, that it would become a pretty woman, his throat being
rather long and thick.”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c020'><b>[214]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>When Holbein painted him he was forty-six years old, and his
face had coarsened and had lost all its youthful freshness and good
looks, but his figure was still erect and kingly, and retained much of
its earlier vigour. In the cartoon he stands boldly and firmly on his
legs, active and alert, though massive in build, and made still broader
in appearance by his rich apparel, heavily padded about the shoulders.
It is in the face that his age and the habits of his life are beginning to
leave ugly indications, though this is not to be gathered from the
cartoon, in which his features, badly rubbed, are now barely discernible.
This, however, may not be entirely due to the accidents
of time, for as the cartoon was made for the purpose of transferring
the leading lines of the composition to the wall, Holbein possibly only
indicated the main outlines, leaving the more careful modelling to be
done on the wall itself. Sadly damaged as the cartoon is, a mere
fragment of the first conception of a great masterpiece, it nevertheless
remains a remarkable and precious work of art, doubly valuable in
that it not only shows us Holbein’s methods of work, but is also the
only record from his own hand we possess to-day in this country of the
most important and celebrated painting he produced while in England.
The whole composition is drawn in with the point of the brush, in the
manner, as Mr. S. Arthur Strong points out, at once broad and minute,
of which Holbein seems to have been the solitary master. In this
crowd of particulars almost everyone else would have lost sight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the whole, and given us a map instead of a view.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c020'><b>[215]</b></a> Mr. Roger E. Fry
speaks of it as one of Holbein’s greatest creations. “It has all the
grandeur of style, the lucidity and ease of arrangement of the greatest
monumental design of Italy, together with a particularity and minuteness
which would seem incompatible with those greater qualities of
style had they not been thus wonderfully united. In all the decorative
details, too, this great work gives us a measure of Holbein’s
impeccable taste at a time when taste was by no means as universal
as it had been in earlier centuries.”<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c020'><b>[216]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>DRAWING OF THE KING AT MUNICH</div>
<p class='c023'>This cartoon was in 1590 in the possession of John, Lord Lumley,
at Lumley Castle, and is entered in the inventory of the pictures as
“The Statuary of King Henry the Eight and his father Kinge Henry
the Seventh Joyned together, doone in white and black by Haunce
Holbyn.” It passed subsequently into the collection of the Duke of
Devonshire, and has been preserved ever since at Hardwick Hall.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c020'><b>[217]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>When it was decided to change the position of the face, it became
necessary for the King to give the painter another sitting, and the
full-face drawing now in the Munich Gallery<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c020'><b>[218]</b></a> is, no doubt, the very
study Holbein made for the purpose. This is not only evident from
its agreement with Van Leemput’s copy, but also from its dimensions.
It is life-size, and thus considerably bigger than any other preliminary
portrait-study by Holbein which has survived. It is in black and red
chalks, on paper prepared with body-colour in the manner practised
by the painter at that period. The study is of the face alone, part of
the hat, the collar, and a small portion of fur on the shoulders being
roughly indicated. The short, scanty beard and the still scantier
whiskers do not conceal the shape of the massive, almost square face,
with its thin eyebrows, fat, heavy cheeks, which from their size make
the mouth look small. He gazes in front of him, his eyes unconscious
of the spectator, as though the thoughts of the sitter were entirely
given to himself. The modelling is masterly, and is obtained by the
simplest means; but the sketch, simple as it appears to be, produces
a wonderful effect of perfect truth to life. Here is the King exactly as
he was, as none other but Holbein could have drawn him. He has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>given not only an absolutely faithful rendering of the face itself, but
has laid bare much of the complex character which lurked behind it,
and the drawing must always remain both one of the artist’s very
finest portrait-studies and also a living document of the utmost value
in the history of Tudor England. How this drawing came to be in
Munich is not known. It was discovered among a number of other
drawings, put aside as of no particular value, by Herr J. H. von
Hefner-Alteneck when he was keeper of the Print Room. It does
not appear to have ever formed a part of the Windsor series of
drawings.</p>

<p class='c023'>The Whitehall painting became the prototype of nine-tenths of
the very numerous portraits of Henry which were produced during his
reign and for some little time afterwards. With one possible exception,
these works are not from Holbein’s own hand; they were all the work
of the less important artists attached to the English court. These,
again, are of very varying degrees of skill, some being but coarse and
common productions, while others have considerable artistic merits.
There is great probability that some of the best of them were from the
workshop of Gerard and Lucas Hornebolt, more particularly those
half-lengths of which the portrait in Warwick Castle is perhaps the
finest example. All, however, had their real origin in the Whitehall
painting; in every one of them the King is shown full-face, and in
the same characteristic attitude.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>OTHER PORTRAITS OF THE KING</div>
<p class='c023'>Interesting as the subject is, the scope of this book does not permit
any attempt to describe, or even to compile a list of, all the portraits
of Henry VIII still remaining in England. A few of the principal
ones may be mentioned briefly. Several of them are full-lengths.
Among these one of the most interesting is in Belvoir Castle.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c020'><b>[219]</b></a> It was
purchased by the fourth Duke of Rutland at Lord Torrington’s sale
in 1787 for £211. Except in some minor details of the dress, it follows
the Whitehall painting very closely. The King is wearing “white
hose, with the Garter on his left leg; a gold chain round his neck with
the letter H, with a pendant circular gold case without any device;
another gold chain or collar across the shoulder over the surcoat is
mounted in jewels set in gold-and-enamel. The whole of the dress and
ornaments is most elaborately painted and gilded, and in excellent
effect of light and colour, being in an absolutely perfect state of
preservation.”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c020'><b>[220]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The copyist has made the face younger and more
handsome, and much more lacking in expression than the Munich
sketch. The background is a curtain with an elaborate design in
panels, each one surmounted by a crown. Dr. Waagen thought
it to be a genuine work by Holbein. “Although painted on canvas,”
he says, “the picture is of such truth, delicacy, and transparency,
that I consider it an original.” A similar whole-length on wood,
belonging to the Seymour family, is described by Dr. Woltmann, who
regarded it as an excellently painted contemporary copy, which very
possibly came into the possession of that family through their connection
with Jane Seymour.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c020'><b>[221]</b></a> There is a far finer example at Petworth,
much more transparent and delicate in its tones, which Wornum describes
as “really magnificent.”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c020'><b>[222]</b></a> This work is by no means an exact
copy; it differs in various details, more particularly in the dress, which
is of silver brocade with a blue mantle lined with ermine. It is
possibly the work of a Fleming. The background is architectural.
There is another full-length version at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital,
with a further variation of the background and the floor. Other
repetitions are at Chatsworth,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c020'><b>[223]</b></a> Trinity College, Cambridge, and in
the possession of Viscount Dillon at Ditchley, Enstone.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c020'><b>[224]</b></a></p>

the royal effigies that are all probably based in common upon the
Hardwick cartoon. The artist, whoever he was, had a manner of his own,
and was more than a mere copyist. The cold grey scheme of colour is a
contrast to the depth and richness at which Holbein aimed, and is more
akin to what we afterwards appreciate as characteristic in Honthorst
and Mytens.”—<i>Critical Studies and Fragments</i>, p. 91. The figure
is evidently copied directly from the wall-painting. The position and
the details of the dress agree exactly with the Hardwick cartoon. It
is reproduced by Dr. Ganz, <i>Holbein</i>, p. 181.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The half-length and three-quarter-length versions, of which the
portraits at Rome and in Warwick Castle are, perhaps, the most
important, are still more numerous. In these the King is shown in
the same position, and apparently several years older, the cheeks
fatter and more shapeless, and with greyer beard, while in a number of
them, instead of holding his dagger, he has a stick in his left hand.
The Warwick picture, which is life-size, to the knees, and full-front,
was considered by Dr. Waagen to be a genuine work by Holbein of
about the date 1530, but more recent criticism has shown him to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>wrong in both these assertions. “The square face is so fat,” he says,
“that the several parts are quite indistinct. There is in these features
a brutal egotism, an obstinacy, and a harshness of feeling, such as I
have never yet seen in any human countenance. In the eyes, too,
there is the suspicious watchfulness of a wild beast, so that I became
quite uncomfortable from looking at it a long time; for the picture,
a masterpiece of Holbein, is as true in the smallest details as if the king
himself stood before you. In the very splendid dress much gold is
employed. The under-sleeves are of gold, with brown shadows; the
hands most strikingly true to nature; in the left he has a cane, and
in the right a pair of gloves; on his head a small cap. The background
is bright green. The want of simplicity of the forms, the little rounding
of the whole, notwithstanding the wonderful modelling of all the
details, the brownish red local tone of the flesh, the grey of the shadows,
and the very light general effect, show this picture to be a transition
from the second to the third manner of Holbein, and that it may have
been painted about 1530.”<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c020'><b>[225]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>It is, however, impossible that the portrait can have been painted
in that year, when Henry was not forty. He appears to be at least
fifteen years older than this. The head and hands are good, but the
style of painting has little in common with that of Holbein, while the
details of the dress lack the beauty, delicacy, and truth of draughtsmanship
which are to be found in his work. There is a portrait in the
collection of the Marquis of Bute, which, according to Dr. Waagen, is
“exactly like the picture by Holbein at Warwick Castle, only less
finished.”<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c020'><b>[226]</b></a> When he saw it, as far back as 1854, it was ascribed to
“Gerard Horebout,” and there is every probability that this attribution
is the correct one, for it is not to be expected that the almost
forgotten name of Hornebolt would have been substituted for the
much better known one of Holbein, and the fact that the former name
has clung to the picture for so long is strong evidence in favour of
the contention that Hornebolt was the painter of it. For this reason
the Warwick portrait, and others like it, are now tentatively attributed
by most modern writers to the workshop of Gerard and Luke
Hornebolt.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF HENRY VIII AT ROME</div>
<p class='c023'>The portrait in the National Gallery, Rome (<a href='#pl-19'>Pl. 19</a>),<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c020'><b>[227]</b></a> which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>formerly in the Corsini Collection, is a three-quarter length, and is
inscribed across the plain background, on either side of the head,
“<span class='sc'>Anno · ætatis · svæ · xlix</span>,” and was, therefore, painted in 1539 or
1540. In dress and position it closely follows Van Leemput’s copy, and
the Windsor and other versions, in which the left hand holds the dagger-cord.
With the exception of the substitution of brown fur for ermine,
and different embroidery on the upper sleeves, the Rome and the
Windsor portraits are in exact agreement as to the costume. The
face in the Rome portrait is decidedly younger than in the Warwick
and Windsor versions, as the date would indicate, so that it is
possibly one of the earliest of the contemporary copies, taken directly
from the wall-painting under Holbein’s own supervision. It is
undoubtedly the best of the later portraits of the King, the face
being full of character finely rendered, and it is regarded by a number
of modern critics, including Dr. Ganz, as a work from Holbein’s own
brush.</p>

<p class='c023'>An important example of this type of the portraits of Henry VIII
is the three-quarter length belonging to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital,
London, which was last exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club
in 1909 (No. 23). The dress is very similar to the Warwick portrait.
The King is grasping in his left hand a black staff mounted in gold.
The background is dark, and on it is inscribed: “<span class='sc'>Anno [~d][~n]i 1544.
ætatis svæ 55</span>,” which is incorrect, as Henry did not enter his fifty-fifth
year until 1545.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c020'><b>[228]</b></a> The portrait in Windsor Castle,<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c020'><b>[229]</b></a> which, as
Mr. Ernest Law points out, is the only contemporary likeness of Henry
in the whole of the royal collections which has anything of an Holbeinesque
character, was evidently copied from the Whitehall fresco. In
the attitude and in the details of the dress it follows the original with
considerable closeness, though slight differences are to be noted, as
in the position of the right hand, which is here placed over the sword-belt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>instead of below it as in Van Leemput’s copy. Its agreement
with the Rome portrait has been already pointed out. The face,
however, more closely resembles the Warwick portrait. Mr. Ernest
Law suggests that it was executed several years later than the Holbein
prototype, by some pupil or imitator, such as Guillim Stretes, after
the master’s death,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c020'><b>[230]</b></a> the general attitude, pose, dress, and accessories
of the original being carefully adhered to, but the features modified,
and the beard shown as thinner and turning grey, to suit his added
years, though in outline they still closely resemble Holbein’s drawing
at Munich. The size of the panel is 3 ft. 3¾ in. high × 2 ft. 5½ in.
wide. It may be the picture which was No. 866 in James II’s catalogue:
“King Henry VIII at half-length, with gloves in his right
hand”; though this description suits equally well the smaller portrait
(18 in. × 16 in.) at Hampton Court, No. 606.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f228'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r228'>228</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is another version of this portrait with the black
staff in the left hand at Chatsworth, in which, Mr. S. Arthur Strong
says, “the drawing of the features is masterly, and the detail is
minute and searching without being petty; but here again the effect is
flat, and we feel that Holbein himself would have better conveyed the
sense of roundness and depth.... On the whole, there is a French
rather than a German look about this picture, which suggests the
possibility that it may have been painted at the time of the Field of
the Cloth of Gold.”—<i>Critical Studies and Fragments</i>, p. 91, and
Pl. ix. i.</p>

<p class='c023'>Another good version of this portrait, with the left hand on the
dagger-cord, is the half-length belonging to the Earl of Yarborough,
while an excellent example of the Warwick Castle type, with a cane
substituted for the dagger, was lent by Lord Sackville to the Burlington
Fine Arts Club in 1909 (No. 21).</p>

<p class='c023'>There is also an excellent portrait of the Warwick type in the
collection of the Duke of Manchester at Kimbolton Castle.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c020'><b>[231]</b></a> It is on
panel, 35 in. × 25 in., and closely resembles the picture in the National
Portrait Gallery (No. 496) (35⅛ in. × 26¼ in.), which is attributed to
Luke Hornebolt.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c020'><b>[232]</b></a> The latter had at one time a coat of arms on the
frame indicating that it belonged at some period to the Nassau family.
It may have been taken over to Holland at the time of the marriage
of Princess Mary, daughter of Charles I, to William of Orange, in 1641.
There are three other portraits of the King in the National Portrait
Gallery, while other versions or old copies exist at Castle Howard,
and at Serlby, the seat of Viscount Galway. The latter (35 in. × 27 in.)
has an inscription on the background giving the King’s titles and the
date 1547, the year of his death. Another (36 in. × 30 in.), at one time
in the collection of Mr. Henry Willett, and now in the Brighton Art
Gallery, is said to have been taken from a wainscot in King’s Walden
House, Herts, formerly the residence of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>All these portraits, whether by the Hornebolts or less important
copyists attached to Henry’s court, are based on Holbein’s Whitehall
painting. There is, however, one other representation of Henry VIII,
of about the date of Holbein’s first entry into the royal service, which
is of a very different character, and was not painted under the influence
of the great German. This is the fine picture at Hampton
Court (No. 563 (313)), generally known as “King Henry VIII with a
Scroll.”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c020'><b>[233]</b></a> He is seen at half-length, with head turned slightly to the
right, but eyes to the front. He has reddish hair, and a small thin
beard and moustache, and his eyes are dark grey. He wears a doublet
of cloth of gold, cut square across the chest, covered with strings of
pearls, and slashed with rows of white puffs, above which his white
frilled shirt is seen. Over this is a sable-furred cloak. His black
cap has a medallion, with figures of the Virgin and Infant Christ in
enamel, and a white jewelled feather. In front of him is a table or ledge
with a crimson cushion, on which his right hand is placed, and a scroll
of white paper, one end of which he holds between the thumb and
forefinger of his left. On it is inscribed a sentence from the Gospel of
St. Mark in Roman lettering: “Marci—16. Ite in Mũdvm Vniversṽ
et predicate Evangelivm omni creatvræ.” The background is a rich
green. It is on panel, 2 ft. 4 in. high × 1 ft. 10 in. wide.</p>

<p class='c023'>The probable authorship of this painting has given rise to much
discussion and difference of opinion. It has been attributed at
different times to Holbein, Janet, Joos van Cleve, and Girolamo da
Treviso, and even to Toto or Penni. Dr. Woltmann considered it
to be the work of a Frenchman, whereas Mr. Wornum was inclined
to attribute it to an Italian hand, possibly Da Treviso. The one
thing certain about it is that it is not by Holbein. There is an equal
difference of opinion as to the date. The King has so youthful a
look, as compared with the Hardwick cartoon and the Munich drawing,
that some writers hold that he cannot have been more than thirty-eight—certainly
not more than forty—when it was painted. This
would make the date about 1529, in which year Holbein was in
Switzerland. On the other hand, there are two facts which point to
a later date—the arrangement of the hair and beard, and the text
on the scroll, which, taken together, make it highly probable that the
portrait was painted in 1536. It was on the 8th of May 1535 that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Henry, in imitation of Francis I, ordered all about his court to cut their
hair short and to grow their beards—“the King commanded all
about his court to poll their heads; and to give them example he
caused his own head to be polled, and from thenceforth his beard to
be knotted and no more shaven.”<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c020'><b>[234]</b></a> In the picture both hair and beard
are treated in the new fashion. Again, on October 4th of the same
year the printing of Coverdale’s English version of the whole Bible,
for which Holbein designed the title-page, was finished, and in 1536
Henry ordered a copy of it to be laid in the choir of every church,
“for every man that will to look and read therein; and shall discourage
no man from reading any part of the Bible, but rather comfort,
exhort, and admonish every man to read the same.” To this the
text on the scroll which Henry holds in the portrait clearly refers;
and further evidence is supplied by the Bible frontispiece, in which
the King is shown under a canopy, with a sword in his right hand, and
a clasped Bible in his left, which he is handing to his kneeling bishops.
One of the little pictures which form the border of the title-page, in
which our Saviour is exhorting His disciples to preach the Word
throughout the world, has the same text (Mark xvi. 15) inscribed below
it. The evidence, therefore, is very strongly in favour of the assumption
that the portrait was painted to commemorate Henry’s share in
the publication of Coverdale’s English version of the Bible. Against
these two arguments in favour of the date 1536, the compilers of the
catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition point out that
the King does not look more than thirty, which would place the
portrait at about the date of the meeting with Francis I at the Field of
the Cloth of Gold in 1520. “The portrait of Eleonora of Spain, wife of
Francis I, also at Hampton Court,” they say, “is evidently by the
same hand; and the smaller portrait of Francis I, also at Hampton
Court, is either by, or a copy after, the same painter. These circumstances
would point to a possible French origin, and lend some colour
to the ascription of the portrait either to “Sotto” Cleef, who worked
in France before coming to England, or to Jean Clouet—more probably
the latter, who may very well have been in attendance on Francis I
at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.”<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c020'><b>[235]</b></a> It is difficult, however, to follow
these writers in their conclusion that the portrait of Eleonora, almost
certainly by the elder Clouet, and the portrait of Henry VIII are by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the same hand, while the fact that in all the earlier portraits of the
King he is shown with long hair, cut straight across the forehead, and
no beard, makes it still more difficult to accept the date as that of the
meeting of the two monarchs in France, unless much stronger evidence
as to its French origin be forthcoming. It is not safe to go farther
than to ascribe it to a Franco-Flemish origin. It should be noted in
passing that a small point in favour of those who see in it a work by
an Italian hand lies in the scroll or cartellino, a feature not often met
with in French or English portraits of that time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“HENRY VIII WITH A SCROLL”</div>
<p class='c023'>On the back of the panel is branded Charles I’s cypher, and there
is also a slip of paper on which is inscribed in contemporary handwriting,
“Changed with my Lord Arundel, 1624.” In Charles’ catalogue,
compiled in 1639, it is entered as “King Henry VIII when he
was young, with a white scroll of parchment in his hand; the picture
being to the shoulders; half a figure so big as the life, in a carved gilded
frame. Length 4 ft. 0. A Whitehall piece, said to be done by Jennet
or Sotto Cleve.” It is possibly the picture in the Commonwealth
inventory—“King Henry y<b>e</b> 8<b>th</b> by Gennett,” which was “sold to
M<b>r.</b> Baggeley y<b>e</b> 23<b>rd</b> Oct. 1651 for £25.” It may also be the “Table
with the picture of King Henry VIII, then being young,” in Edward
VI’s catalogue. An early and interesting copy of this picture, on
canvas, 28¾ in. × 22¼ in., is in the possession of the Merchant Taylors’
Company, which was in the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 120), and the
Burlington Club Exhibition, 1909 (No. 24). In the catalogue of the
former exhibition it was attributed to Paris Bordone. It was presented
to the Company in 1616 by Mr. John Vernon. There is a
third version of the picture in the Marquis of Exeter’s collection at
Burleigh House, in which the same Latin verse is inscribed on the
scroll. Dr. Waagen says that “it is very carefully painted in a
brownish tone.”<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c020'><b>[236]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>In addition to the Hardwick cartoon and the Munich drawing
there is a third portrait of Henry existing which can be attributed
almost certainly to Holbein’s hand. This is the beautiful little
panel in Lord Spencer’s collection at Althorp (<a href='#frontis'><i>frontispiece</i></a>),<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c020'><b>[237]</b></a> which
measures only 10½ in. × 7½ in. It is a half-length, three-quarters to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>right. No hair is visible under the cap or beside the ears; the hairs of
the close-cropped fair beard and moustache are drawn with minute care.
The eyes are clear blue-grey. He wears a black cap trimmed with
jewels and loops of pearls and a white feather falling to the left. His
gown of cloth of gold is lined with brown fur, over a light grey doublet
cut low at the neck, embroidered with an elaborate pattern in black,
trimmed with jewels and slashed and puffed with white. The white shirt
has a high collar fitting close round the neck, embroidered with a rich
design in gold, and with a very small frill. On his breast is a round
jewel suspended by a chain of spiral black and gold beads and H’s.
The hands are shown in part, the left at his side, and the right holding
a glove. The background is a plain bright blue.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF HENRY VIII AT ALTHORP</div>
<p class='c023'>It is a miniature painting of unusual size, and is drawn with
extraordinary delicacy and truth, and there is an exquisite finish in
all the details of the dress and ornaments, and a harmony in the
colour, which no other painter then practising at the English court
but Holbein was capable of producing. The first impression it gives
is that, in spite of its beauty and brilliance, it yet displays certain
differences from Holbein’s usual style which renders its attribution to
him not absolutely certain; but repeated examination modifies this
first impression, and it becomes impossible not to agree with such
critics as Dr. Woltmann, Mr. Lionel Cust, and Dr. Ganz, who are
emphatically of opinion that Holbein was the author of it. It is impossible,
again, to find any other painter who could have produced
so vivid and striking a portrait of the King, and so accomplished a
work of art. Mr. Roger E. Fry describes it as one of Holbein’s most
miraculous pieces of craftsmanship. “It is little more in scale than
a large miniature, and Holbein has treated it with all the skill in
minute delineation which he alone possessed, and that without losing
for a moment unity of tone and breadth of feeling; but, wonderful
as it is, it gives one scarcely any idea of an actual character. Holbein
seems never to have read anything behind the expansive mask of his
royal patron; whether he abstained out of discretion or failed from
want of interest one can but guess.”<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c020'><b>[238]</b></a> After examining the Munich
head, however, it is difficult to agree with Mr. Fry’s opinion that
Holbein saw nothing of Henry’s real character. The Althorp panel
is almost identical in position and dress with the original cartoon for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the Whitehall wall-painting, and it is probable that Holbein intended
to use it as his model for the latter. It must have been painted in
1537, before the wall-painting itself was begun, or at least before the
change in the position of the King’s head was decided upon. It
may be the portrait which in the inventory of Henry VIII’s pictures,
made at his death, was joined to that of Queen Jane Seymour in a
diptych—“Item, a table like a booke, with the picture of Kynge
Henry theight and Quene Jane”; though, if so, the corresponding
portrait of Jane Seymour is lost, for the one of that queen in the
Vienna Gallery is much larger than Lord Spencer’s portrait. The
latter was at South Kensington in 1862 (No. 2651), and again in 1865
(No. 2028), and at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 38).</p>

for Singer’s edition of Cavendish’s <i>Life of Wolsey</i>, 1825. The background
is now very dark, but in the engraving it is shown to be a

Spencer’s panel. There is also a somewhat weak copy of it among
the miniatures in the Duke of Buccleuch’s collection, which, like the
original, has no inscription. It has suffered extensive repairs at
some time or other, and the eyes are now a bright chestnut colour,

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF QUEEN JANE SEYMOUR</div>
<p class='c023'>Jane Seymour was the first of Henry’s queens to be painted by
Holbein. The various portraits of Katherine of Aragon and Anne
Boleyn still existing are not by him, and it is evident that the artist
did not enter the royal service until after Anne’s execution on 19th
May 1536, and Henry’s very precipitate marriage with Jane Seymour
on the following day. Portraits of both these ladies are usually
ascribed to Holbein by their owners, according to the prevailing fashion
of earlier days, when everything dating from Tudor times was unhesitatingly
given to him. Shortly before Holbein’s return to England
in 1532, Katherine of Aragon had permanently retired from court,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and in the seclusion of The Moor, deserted by the King, her thoughts
fully occupied with her impending divorce, it is not likely that she
would have any desire to sit for her portrait, or to command Holbein
to visit her for that purpose. There is more probability that Anne
Boleyn may have been painted by him, but as no such portrait has
been discovered, it must be taken for granted that he did not. The
head among the Windsor drawings, inscribed “Anna Bollein Queen,”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c020'><b>[241]</b></a>
has been wrongly named, and bears no likeness to the few portraits
which may be said with some degree of certainty to represent her.
Much information respecting the portraits of these two queens will
be found in the papers read by Mr. John Gough Nichols and Sir George
Scharf before the Society of Antiquaries in 1863 and published in
<i>Archæologia</i>.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c020'><b>[242]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>There is no evidence to show that Holbein painted either Katherine’s
daughter, Mary, or Anne’s daughter, Elizabeth, though here again
portraits of them exist which in less critical days were said to be by
him. The drawing in the Windsor Collection inscribed “The Lady
Mary after Queen,”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c020'><b>[243]</b></a> has no claim to represent Queen Mary, nor is
there any known portrait of her which bears any likeness to Holbein’s
style of painting. The Princess Elizabeth was ten years old at the
time of the painter’s death, whereas the youngest portrait of her
extant is the very interesting one at the age of about fifteen or sixteen
in the Royal Collection,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c020'><b>[244]</b></a> which was included in Charles I’s catalogue
as “A Whitehall piece of Holben,” and said to represent “Queen
Elizabeth when she was young, to the waist.” This is probably a
work of Franco-Flemish origin, and has nothing to do with Holbein,
who, if he had painted her, must have shown her as a little girl. Mr.
Nichols, in his paper mentioned above, states that “there can be little
doubt that Holbein drew the King’s natural son, Henry FitzRoy,
Duke of Richmond and Suffolk, who lived until the 22nd July 1536,”
but no such portrait or drawing of him can be discovered. There is,
however, among the Windsor heads, a drawing of his wife, Mary,<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c020'><b>[245]</b></a>
daughter of Thomas, third Duke of Norfolk, and sister of Henry, Earl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>of Surrey, both of whom sat to Holbein. It is a fine drawing, but very
badly rubbed. She is represented full-face, with the eyes cast down,
and wearing a close-fitting white cap or hood, and a large flat black
hat with a big ostrich feather. The dress is powdered with the letter
R, which in some cases seems to be formed of pearls, while the letter M
also occurs twice. This fashion of wearing an initial letter, usually
as a pendant ornament, was by no means unusual at that period, and
occurs in more than one of Holbein’s portraits. The drawing of the
Duchess is inscribed “The Lady of Richmond.”</p>

<p class='c023'>It is not until we come to the portrait of Queen Jane Seymour
in the Imperial Gallery, Vienna (No. 1481) (<a href='#pl-20'>Pl. 20</a>),<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c020'><b>[246]</b></a> that we are on
certain ground. This is a genuine work of Holbein of very fine quality.
She is shown almost to the knees, the body and head turned slightly
to the left, and her hands clasped in front of her. She is dressed in
red velvet, with hanging sleeves covered with gold embroidery, and
under-sleeves of lilac-grey watered silk with an elaborate pattern,
worked with seed pearls, and slashed and puffed with white. The
cuffs have a deep border of wonderfully painted black Spanish work.
She wears two heavy necklaces, of jewels and pearls, and a band of
similar ornament along the edge of her square-cut bodice, and an
ornament at the breast composed of the initials I.H.S. and three
pendant pearls. Her head-dress is of the angular English pattern.
The inner cap, which completely hides her hair, is of brown silk with
a black stripe, and the jewelled band or framework is of the same
pattern as the border of the dress. The body of the head-dress is
cloth of gold, with the customary black fall. The background is of
dark grey-blue without inscription. The colour scheme is rich and
harmonious, but delicate and pearly in tone, and a considerable amount
of gold has been used in the painting of the jewels, and the gold tissue
and embroidery of the cap. Once again the extraordinarily fine painting
of the hands has to be recorded; they are full of expression and
character. There is less expression in the face. She has no great
pretensions to beauty, and her complexion is pale, thus agreeing with
all contemporary accounts of her appearance. In a singularly frank
letter from Chapuys to Antoine Perrenot, dated London, 18th May 1536,
which was intended for the Emperor’s ears, the Spanish ambassador
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>says: “She is sister to one Edward Semel, of middle stature, and no
great beauty, so fair that one would call her rather pale than otherwise....
The said Semel is not a woman of great wit, but she may
have good understanding. It is said she inclines to be proud and
haughty. She bears great love and reverence to the Princess (<i>i.e.</i>
Mary). I know not if honors will make her change hereafter.”<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c020'><b>[247]</b></a>
He then proceeds to throw doubts upon the lady’s virtue, and to
speak in coarse innuendo of Henry’s matrimonial ventures. The
panel, which is probably the one which was in the Arundel Collection,
measures 65 cm. by 48 cm., and is of the same size as the portrait
of Dr. John Chamber; they are the largest of Holbein’s works in the
Vienna Gallery. This portrait was evidently the one seen by Van
Mander in Amsterdam in 1604. He says: “There was, at Amsterdam,
in the Warmoesstraat, a portrait of a Queen of England, admirably
executed, and very pretty and nice; she was attired in silver brocade,
which appears to be genuine silver with some admixture, and it was
depicted so transparently, curiously, and exquisitely, that a white foil
seemed to lie beneath.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c020'><b>[248]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The original study for this portrait is in the Windsor Collection.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c020'><b>[249]</b></a>
It is a fine drawing of very delicate draughtsmanship, and shows more
of the figure than most of the sketches in the series, the folded hands
being included. Several replicas of the picture still remain in England,
the two best of which, excellent contemporary copies, are in the Duke
of Bedford’s collection at Woburn Abbey, and in that of Lord Sackville
at Knole. The latter was in the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 44),
and the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 46). Another version
is in the possession of the Duke of Northumberland. Hollar made an
admirable engraving from the Arundel version, a small circle dated
1648 (Parthey 1427); and there is at Windsor, as already noted, a
miniature painted from it by Nicholas Hilliard, which is inscribed
“<span class='sc'>Anō Dnī 1536 ætatis svæ 27</span>.”<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c020'><b>[250]</b></a> Hilliard, no doubt,
found this inscription on the original from which he worked, but
nothing of the kind is now discernible either on the picture in Vienna
or Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Sackville’s version. It may, however, have been taken from one of
the numerous miniatures of this Queen, dealt with in a later chapter.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c020'><b>[251]</b></a>
This inscription is valuable as giving the probable date at which
Holbein painted the Queen, and proves that he was in the royal
service as early as in the summer of 1536. Very probably the
portrait was afterwards used by him as the basis for the head and
position of Jane in the Whitehall wall-painting. There is an excellent
old copy of the portrait in the Hague Gallery (No. 278) which shows
slight differences.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c020'><b>[252]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>In addition to this portrait, Holbein prepared a design for a large
gold cup, bearing the initials of Henry and Jane, and the latter’s
motto, evidently intended as a present from the King to his consort.
The finished drawing is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and there is
another version of it in the British Museum. It is the most important
of Holbein’s designs for goldsmith’s work which has been preserved,
and is described in a later chapter.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c020'><b>[253]</b></a> Henry VIII appears to have been

ON the very day of Jane Seymour’s death, the King and
his Council began, with almost indecent haste, their
search throughout the Courts of Europe for a new
queen to fill her place. Henry’s ambassadors and
agents were instructed to make discreet inquiries as
to suitable candidates, and before the close of the
year a number of names had been submitted to him for his
consideration. In spite of this unseemly expedition, however, nearly
two years were to elapse before the final choice was made, for
it was not until the very end of 1539 that Anne of Cleves came to
England as Henry’s fourth queen. Throughout the whole of 1538
marriage negotiations, which in the end proved fruitless, were
carried on simultaneously with Francis I and the Emperor Charles V.
Though Henry was anxious to marry again, in order that the
succession, which rested on the precarious life of one infant
Prince, might be made more assured, yet his search for a bride
both in France and in Imperial circles at one and the same time
was undertaken quite as much for political as for matrimonial
reasons. It was his main object at that time to prevent any close
understanding between his two rivals. With Charles and Francis
united, and Europe at peace, there was nothing to prevent a coalition
against England and an enforcement of the papal excommunication
of Henry by force of arms. By playing off one monarch against the
other with the bait of a proffered matrimonial alliance he hoped to
keep the two apart, and by such means ensure the security of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>throne, and be at liberty to continue the severe methods by which he
sought to maintain his supremacy as self-appointed head of the English
Church.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SEARCH FOR A FOURTH QUEEN</div>
<p class='c023'>In the course of these negotiations quite a number of ladies were
suggested, and in most, if not in all, cases, portraits of them were procured
for Henry’s inspection. In some instances he sent his own
painter for the purpose; in others, what may be termed “official”
portraits, painted by foreigners, were forwarded to England by his
ambassadors abroad. Of these portraits, two—those of the Duchess
of Milan and of the Princess Anne of Cleves—were painted by Holbein,
who was despatched to Brussels and to Düren in order to take their
likenesses; but the authorship of the others is less certain, and as
the portraits themselves cannot now be traced, it is difficult, if not
impossible, to arrive at any final conclusion respecting them. There
is much probability, however, amounting in two instances almost to
certainty, that Holbein made other special journeys, in addition to
the two just mentioned, for the purpose of painting ladies who had
been reported to the King as beautiful or desirable. These journeys
were to France, and solve, in the writer’s opinion, the mysterious
journey to Upper Burgundy; but as the negotiations for a French
marriage were running concurrently with those for the hand of the
Duchess of Milan, it will be better, in order to avoid confusion, to deal
separately with each of these proposed alliances, and the various
portraits to which they gave rise. For this reason the present chapter
is concerned with Holbein’s painting of the Duchess, while in the
following one evidence is brought forward which indicates that he
also received orders from the King to take the likenesses of several
high-born ladies of France.</p>

<p class='c023'>Shortly after the imposing funeral ceremonies of Queen Jane
Seymour, Cromwell wrote to John Hutton, the English agent in
Brussels at the court of the Regent of the Netherlands, Queen Mary of
Hungary, the Emperor’s sister, to ask him to make secret inquiries
as to suitable brides for the King, and in Hutton’s reply, dated
December 4, 1537, occurs the first mention of the Duchess of Milan as
a possible Queen of England. Hutton wrote:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Uppon the recept of your letters addressid unto me by this

<p class='c023'>The Duchess reached Brussels shortly after this letter was despatched,
and Hutton wrote again to Cromwell on the 9th of December,
after a personal inspection of the lady, whom he thought to be very
like Mrs. Shelton, one of Anne Boleyn’s ladies, as follows:</p>

<p class='c023'>In a transcript of the same letter, addressed to Thomas Wriothesley,
one of Cromwell’s secretaries, and despatched to England on the same
date, Hutton added:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Ther is non in theis parties off parsonage, beawtie, and byrthe,

<p class='c023'>He wrote still further in her praise in a third letter to Cromwell,

<p class='c023'>These descriptions were considered to be so satisfactory that
Hutton’s other suggestions were discarded, and the young Duchess
selected as a possible wife for Henry, if good terms could be arranged.
Christina of Denmark, youngest daughter of King Christian II of
Denmark and Isabella of Hungary, sister of Charles V, was born in
1523, and had been married, in 1534, when only eleven years of age, to
Francesco Maria Sforza, the last Duke of Milan, who died in the
following year, October 24, 1535. She was now in her sixteenth year,
and as the niece of the Emperor, a marriage with her, so Henry and
his Council considered, would be of great political advantage, as it
would give the world a proof that his quarrel with Charles over the
divorce of Katherine of Aragon was at an end. Henry, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>wrote on January 22, 1538, to Sir Thomas Wyat, his ambassador in
Spain, ordering him to suggest the marriage to the Emperor, who in
his reply, sent through his representative in London, Eustace Chapuys,
declared that he would be glad to treat of it. Henry, who naturally
wished to see the lady, if possible, before committing himself too far,
began to throw out suggestions that she should be brought to Calais,
in order that he might make her acquaintance, but this proposal was
displeasing to the other parties concerned; and so, as the next best
thing, it was determined to obtain her portrait. Hutton was instructed
to procure one if he possibly could, and he wrote to Cromwell
on February 21, describing a dinner-party he had attended given by
the “Ladie Marqueis of Barrough,” at which she promised to show
him, when finished, a portrait for which the Duchess of Milan was
sitting, and for the purpose of which she had put off her mourning
dress. This picture, apparently, was to be given to the Lady Marquis.
He told Cromwell:</p>

<p class='c025'>“The Lady Marqueis demaundid of me, yff the letters, wiche I
had delyverid the Queyn, cam from the Kynges Highnes my master.
Unto wiche I made answar that the cam frome the Empror. Then
she said that when she sawe me delyver them, hir hart rejoissid,
thynkyng ther had byne some good newis consarnyng the Duches of
Myllain, of whom she made great preis, as well for hir beawtie, favor,
wisdom, as for hir myche gentilnes. All wiche saynges I affirmyd.
Withe that she said, yf I had seyn hir owt of hir mornyng aparell, so
gorgeosly as she had seyn hir the day beffore, I wold have marveillid,
for she said, to tell me in secret, she cawssid hir pikture to be made,
wiche beyng fenisshed, the Duches had promissid to give it unto hir,
soo that she of hir owen motion said, assone as it cam to hir handes I

</div>

<p class='c023'>He goes on to describe an interview with the Duchess on the
following day, in which she complained of the rain, telling Hutton,
“This wether likythe not the Queyn, for She is therby pynnyd upp,
that She cannot ride abrode to hunt. Then I demandid if Hir Grace
did not love huntyng. She answered, ‘Non better,’ and soo pawssid.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOBY AND HOLBEIN GO TO BRUSSELS</div>
<p class='c023'>Matters seemed now to be progressing so favourably that it was
decided to send over Philip Hoby to Brussels, with some show of
secrecy, for the purpose of a personal interview with the young lady,
and, as Henry was very anxious to obtain an accurate likeness of her,
it was also arranged that Holbein should go with him, without waiting
for the portrait which Hutton hoped to secure.</p>

<p class='c023'>Philip Hoby, who was born in 1505, was the son of William Hoby,
of Leominster. His zeal for the Reformation commended him to
Henry VIII and Cromwell, by whom he was constantly employed
from 1538 onwards in diplomatic services at the courts of Spain and
Portugal, and on special missions elsewhere. He was one of the
gentlemen ushers of the King’s Privy Chamber, and took part in the
siege of Boulogne, being rewarded with knighthood immediately after
the conquest of that town in the autumn of 1544. He was made
Master of the Ordnance and admitted to the Privy Council in 1552,
and died in 1558. From his correspondence he appears to have been
a man of culture and refinement. Holbein made two, if not three,
journeys abroad in his company, and painted his portrait, though its
whereabouts is not now known, but the drawing for it, in which he is
shown with a scanty beard and long thin moustache, is in the Windsor
Collection.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c020'><b>[260]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Cromwell’s instructions to Hoby were as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Instructions given by the L. Cromwell to Philip Hoby sent over
by him to the duchess of Lorraine then [to the] duchess of Milan.</p>

<p class='c030'>“To repair to Mr. Hutton and tarry secretly at his lodging until
he shall have been with the Regent. Then upon Hutton’s advertisement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to go to the Duchess, present Cromwell’s commendations and
say that no doubt she had heard from the Lady Regent and by the
relation of the King’s ambassador there, the cause of his coming and
Cromwell’s inclination to the advancement of the same as is declared
‘in the letter.’ He shall then beg her to take the pain to sit that a
servant of the King, who is come thither for that purpose, may take
her physiognomy; and shall ask when Mr. Hanns shall come to her
to do so. The said Philip shall as of himself express a wish that both
for my Lord’s reports of her virtues and for his own view of them, it
might please the King, being now without a wife, to advance her to
the honour of a queen of England. ‘And he shall well note her
answers, her gesture and countenance with her inclination, that he
may at his return declare the same to the King’s Majesty.’ Her
picture taken, he and Hanns shall return immediately.”<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c020'><b>[261]</b></a> Hoby was
also supplied with a second document, in which all that he was to say
to the Duchess was carefully drawn up for his guidance.</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f261'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r261'>261</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>C.L.P.</i>, vol. xiii. pt. i. 380(2).</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In the heading to these instructions, which is written in a later
hand than the body of the document, the words “to the” in square
brackets have been inserted by the editor of the <i>Calendars of Letters
and Papers, &amp;c.</i> In doing this he has been misled by a very similar
set of instructions issued to Hoby on the eve of a mission to Lorraine
in August of the same year, which is dealt with in the next chapter.
He thus reads the heading as indicating that Hoby was to go first of
all to the Duchess of Lorraine and afterwards to the Duchess of
Milan, and that the one set of instructions was to serve for the two
visits. The inserted words, “to the,” however, are not needed.
Christina, a few years after Holbein painted her, married, in 1540,
François, Duke of Bar and Lorraine, and the writer who added the
heading to the copy of Hoby’s instructions quite correctly describes
her as the Duchess of Lorraine, “then (or “at that time,” <i>i.e.</i> at the
time of Hoby’s journey to Brussels) Duchess of Milan.” This is a
small point, but it is necessary to draw attention to it, as it has to do
with Holbein’s subsequent journey to Upper Burgundy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOBY AND HOLBEIN IN BRUSSELS</div>
<p class='c023'>The two travellers left London on the 2nd or 3rd of March, and
reached Brussels on the evening of the 10th. The next day was
spent in preliminary interviews, Hutton having audience with the
Lady Regent and the Duchess in the morning, and Hoby delivering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>his message to the latter in the afternoon. All going smoothly,
Holbein was fetched to the court at one o’clock on the 12th, and
accomplished all that he had to do within three hours, to the great
admiration of Hutton, who considered that he showed himself to be
a master, and that the likeness was very perfect. The English agent,
the day before their arrival, had already despatched a portrait of the
lady to London—in all probability the one promised him by the
Lady Marquis—but after seeing Holbein’s beautiful drawing, he sent
a messenger post haste to stop the bearer of the first picture, which
he now regarded as but “slobbered” in comparison with the other.
Hoby and Holbein, who started upon their homeward journey on the
evening of the 12th, appear to have taken this inferior picture with
them, so that Cromwell might compare the two. There is no evidence
to indicate by whom it was painted, but as the lady was represented
in gay apparel, it must have been in marked contrast to Holbein’s
study and the full-length portrait he afterwards painted, representing
her in her Italian widow’s weeds. It is possible that this picture is
still in existence in England, and its discovery would be most
interesting.</p>

<p class='c023'>Hutton’s letter to Cromwell, describing all that took place on
the occasion, is a long one, but as it is one of the few important
documents still existing in which Holbein is mentioned by name, it
cannot well be omitted here. It is dated March 14, 1538, and runs as
follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“My moste bounden duetie remembered unto Your good Lordshipe.

<div class='sidenote'>HUTTON’S ACCOUNT OF HOLBEIN’S VISIT</div>
<p class='c023'>The Queen Regent wrote to Eustace Chapuys in London, directly
after Hoby’s departure, saying that: “I deem it opportune to acquaint
you with a fact, of which you are not perhaps aware, namely,
that Sieur Cromwell has sent here expressly a man, besides a message
by ambassador Hauton, to the effect that the Emperor had proposed
to the King, his master, the marriage of my niece, the dowager duchess
of Milan, with honourable and advantageous conditions; that he
(the Emperor) offers to help efficiently towards it, and wishes it to
take place before King Francis becomes aware of it. Cromwell asks
that the man be allowed to see and talk with my said niece, and take
her portrait in order to show it to the King and give him greater
desire to see her. This I have allowed, and the man has actually
returned to England with the portrait, well satisfied with the personal
appearance and manners of my said niece, who has not failed on the
occasion to thank Cromwell for his offers and show of affection.”<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c020'><b>[263]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>From Chapuys’ reply to her, dated March 23, we learn that
Hoby and Holbein reached London on March 18, and that the King
was delighted with the latter’s handiwork. He tells her:</p>

<p class='c025'>“On the very same day, the 18th, the painter sent by this King
to Flanders came back with the Duchess’ likeness, which, I am told,
has singularly pleased the King, so much so, that since he saw it he
has been in much better humor than he ever was, making musicians
play on their instruments all day long. Two days after he went to
dine at a splendid house of his, where he had collected all his musicians,
and, after giving orders for the erection of certain sumptuous buildings
therein, returned home by water, surrounded by musicians, and
went straight to visit the duchess of Suffocq, the mother-in-law of the
duke of Norfolk, and the wife of his brother, and ever since cannot be
one single moment without masks, which is a sign he purposes to
marry again, unless he does all that by way of dissimulation whilst
the bishop of Tarbes is here still.”<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c020'><b>[264]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF THE DUCHESS AT WINDSOR</div>
<p class='c023'>No doubt the portrait which so delighted the King was one of
those masterly studies in black chalk touched with colour, such as
the “John Godsalve” among the Windsor drawings, from which
Holbein afterwards painted the magnificent full-length now in the
National Gallery. He could not have done much more than this in
the three hours which was the whole time allowed him for the sitting.
Sir Claude Phillips, however, is of opinion that it must have been
something more than a drawing, however consummate—perhaps a
finished sketch of the head only in oils. “It is difficult to believe,”
he says, “that a layman would express so enthusiastic an approval
of a drawing of modest dimensions, and (if it followed the usual
Windsor type) of modest aspect. Neither sketch, however, nor
drawing is known to exist.”<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c020'><b>[266]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>It was suggested by the late Sir George Scharf, F.S.A., that the
small oil panel, showing the Duchess to the waist, which is practically
a replica of the upper half of the National Gallery picture, is the
original study made by Holbein in Brussels. This portrait, then
unnamed, he discovered in 1863, in a small apartment in Windsor
Castle, and it was described by him in a paper read before the Society
of Antiquaries, and published in <i>Archæologia</i>, with a good lithograph
of the picture by T. H. Maguire.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c020'><b>[267]</b></a> It is on wood, 17 in. high by 13 in.

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r267'>267</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Remarks on a Portrait of the Duchess of Milan, recently
discovered at Windsor Castle, probably painted by Holbein at Brussels
in the year 1538,” <i>Archæologia</i>, 1866, vol. xl. p. 106.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>“The picture by Holbein,” says Sir George, “could only have
been a drawing or a painting on rather a small scale, inasmuch as it
had at once to be conveyed by a messenger to England, and one of
the objects of Hutton’s letter was to show the diligence with which
the King’s commands were executed and to announce the coming of
the picture. The scale and workmanship of the picture before us
are exactly such as might have been expected from a first-rate painter
and tactician under such circumstances. All essential points are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>observed with scrupulous fidelity, and, certainly, as far as internal
evidence extends, without flattery. It is not to be supposed that
Holbein did nothing to the picture beyond the term of the three
hours’ sitting afforded by the Duchess. Having secured all the
essential points of likeness, and given the general colouring, he doubtless
spent some time in further finishings from memory. But time
must have been given for the picture to dry.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Wornum, however, refuses to accept Sir George’s ascription.
“The head is vigorously painted,” he says, “and very natural; it
shows, however, no complete finish, which, if the picture referred to,
is exactly what one would expect; but it lacks also the mastery one
would expect to find in a free sketch by Holbein. The hands are
inferior, but they appear to have been partly repainted; the background
has also been entirely repainted.... In its present state, it
looks much more like a clever study from the Arundel picture, than its
pattern; anyhow the distance between them is immense, but this
does not prove much, for a very inferior master to Holbein could
elaborate a magical effect from a mere rough sketch, provided this
possessed the real germs of truth in it.”<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c020'><b>[268]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF THE DUCHESS AT WINDSOR</div>
<p class='c023'>Woltmann, too, was of opinion that this small panel was not an
original work by Holbein. “We cannot find in the picture at Windsor,”
he says “that freedom and bold masterly style which absolutely belong
to a sketch from life, and which alone could have excited such lively
admiration in John Hutton. The picture at Windsor is very pretty
and graceful, but has something almost sober in its treatment. It
can indeed be just as little a copy from the large painting. It exhibits
some differences in the costume, for instance, a somewhat larger fur
collar, and another position of the fingers, although the characteristic
attitude of the hands is essentially the same. Christina also wears
three rings instead of a single one; namely, a black widow’s ring on
the little finger of the right hand, and on the next finger a gold hoop
with a square black stone. We might, therefore, believe that this is
a copy by another hand of the sketch Holbein painted from life. In
favour of this opinion, we find the head, which the sketch naturally
gave most distinctly, by far the best part of the painting, while the
rest, which was only indicated in the sketch, appears far weaker.”<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c020'><b>[269]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f269'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r269'>269</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, 1st ed., English translation, pp. 426-7.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Sir George Scharf describes with care the many small differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>between the two works. In addition to the three rings instead of
one, mentioned by Woltmann, the fur of the dress in the smaller
picture is much deeper and has every appearance of being a wide fur
collar separate from and placed over the black dress. In the larger
portrait the fur is much narrower, and evidently forms the lining and
collar of the outer robe, a narrow edging of it being shown down the
front. In the National Gallery picture, too, this outer robe is open
several inches in front, showing the under-dress of black and the
knotted ribbon at the waist, all of which are missing in the Windsor
panel. Again, though the hands holding the gloves have the same
general position in both, the position of the fingers shows considerable
variation. In the smaller portrait the two last fingers of the right
hand and the two middle ones of the left are bent inwards; in the
larger, the only bent fingers are the two last of the left hand. There
are some other minor differences which need not be specified.</p>

<p class='c023'>Both pictures at one time belonged to Henry VIII, and are included
in the inventory of that King’s “money, jewels, plate, utensils, apparel,
wardrobe stuffs, goods and chattels, consigned to the care of Sir
Anthony Denny at Westminster.” The volume, now in the Record
Office, is dated April 24, 1542. They appear again in a similar inventory,
made after Henry’s death, taken “by vertue of a Commission
under the greate seale of England, bearing date at Westminster
the viij day of September, in the first year of our Sovereyne Lord
Edwarde the Sixte” (1547). In these, the smaller panel is described
as “Item, a Table with a Picture of the Duchesse of Myllayne.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Woltmann’s conjecture that it is a contemporary copy made from
Holbein’s original sketch appears to be the true one, though for whom
made it is now impossible to say. There seems to be no reason why
Henry, having the full-length panel in his possession, should have
commissioned this smaller and inferior one. If ordered by Thomas
Cromwell, which is not very likely, it may have reached the King in
the form of plunder after the former’s execution; if done in order to
be sent to the Duchess herself, it is strange that it should have remained
in England. In any case, it cannot have been the “slobbered”
work which Hutton, in his eagerness to serve his royal master, had
hurriedly despatched on its way to London on the eve of Holbein’s
arrival in Brussels. All the evidence points to the latter as being the
portrait of the Duchess “out of her mourning apparel” which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>to be given to the Lady Marquess, who had promised to show it to
Hutton when finished, as his letter tells us. Hutton, pleading urgency,
and knowing that the latter lady was in favour of the match, in all
probability borrowed it, or begged it as a gift.</p>

<p class='c023'>This portrait of the Duchess of Milan,<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c020'><b>[270]</b></a> 70 in. by 32 in. (<a href='#pl-21'>Pl. 21</a>),
is incomparably the greatest work from Holbein’s brush now remaining
in England; it is, indeed, in many respects his masterpiece. It is
of additional interest and value, too, as being the only full-length, life-size
portrait of a lady painted by him. She is represented standing,
facing and looking towards the spectator, her hands in front of her holding
her gloves. She is dressed in mourning apparel as the widow of
Sforza, a gown of plain black satin tied round the waist with a black
cord, and a long black cloak reaching to her feet, lined with yellow sable,
with a collar of the same fur, open in the front sufficiently to allow a part
of her dress to be seen. At her neck and wrists are white frills with a
narrow black edging, and on her head a closely-fitting black cap, which
covers all her hair, and a part of her forehead. The gloves are pale
buff, and her only ornament is a gold ring with a red stone, probably a
cornelian, on the third finger of her left hand. The floor on which she
stands is of pale yellow-brown colour, though no floor-boards are
indicated, and the background is a plain one of deep blue, now almost
black, only broken by the white cartellino over the sitter’s left
shoulder, which is affixed to the wall with four dabs of red sealing-wax.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Holbein made the choice of a true artist in thus depicting her in
her widow’s weeds instead of in all the bravery of the court dress
which she was again beginning to assume. The effect of fine rich
colour produced by this wonderful rendering of a plain black costume
is masterly, but in no way detracts the attention of the spectator
from the grace of the slender form and the vitality and subtle expression
of the face, as more elaborate accessories might have done.
The whole panel is painted with the utmost simplicity and directness,
and yet is stamped with real grandeur of style in every delicate stroke
of the brush. The modelling of the flesh is rendered with extraordinary
delicacy, while the tints are unusually transparent, and a faint rosy
glow of health just flushes her cheeks. Her dark-brown eyes, from
under fair eyebrows, look out upon the world with an intensity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>expression which is surpassed in few, if any, portraits by the greatest
masters; the red lips are full of character, but not more so than the
hands, which are exquisitely painted. In the painting of hands
Holbein was always a master, but he never accomplished anything
finer in this direction than those of the young Duchess. The portrait,
indeed, bears the stamp of truth in every line. The painter, who
never exaggerated, has made no attempt to add to the lady’s beauty;
such as she was he painted her. The draperies are admirably arranged,
and the painting of fur and satin as good as anything Holbein ever
did, even in such portraits as that of Gisze. The restrained but
stately attitude of the young girl, still only on the threshold of womanhood,
the refined, reserved, and dignified character in the fresh young
face, which, though gentle, is in no way lacking in strength, and the
sense of humour lurking in the lips, combine to produce an effect which
is fascinating in the highest degree; indeed, in the simplicity of its
methods, the strength, refinement, and elegance of its conception, and
in its extraordinary vitality, it must always remain not only Holbein’s
masterpiece in the portraiture of women, but one of the greatest
portraits in the world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>NATIONAL GALLERY PORTRAIT</div>
<p class='c023'>There is no doubt that Holbein painted the portrait immediately
after his return from Brussels, although some writers have suggested
that it is a year or so later in date than 1538. This conclusion is based
largely on the supposition that Holbein’s visit to High Burgundy later
in the same year was for the purpose of obtaining further sittings from
the Duchess; but this is an error, as will be shown in the next chapter.
The portrait was painted for Henry, and would naturally be done at
once, before the negotiations for the marriage were broken off, and it
remained in his collection throughout his life. Holbein was out of
England more often and for a longer period in 1538 than has been
generally supposed. In addition to at least one other continental
journey on the King’s service, he was absent from about the middle of
August until nearly Christmas, and thus everything indicates that
this important panel was painted in April or May.</p>

<p class='c023'>Another argument, advanced by Sir George Scharf in favour of
the contention that it was painted some time after 1538, is that the
name and titles of the lady written on the fictitious piece of paper
attached to the dark background near to her left shoulder, by four
dabs of sealing-wax, designate her “Duchess of Lorraine.” This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>inscription Sir George reads as: “Christine, Daughter to Christierne K.
of Deñarke, and Dutchess of Lotragne and heretofore (?) Dutches of
Milan.” The writing, however, is much rubbed, and is by no means
easy to decipher; thus the word which Sir George read as “heretofore,”
Mr. Wornum considered to be “hered” (hereditary). “This,” Sir
George goes on to say, “would, if the writing be contemporary with
the picture, bring the date to 1541, the year of her second marriage
to Francis, Duke of Lorraine and Barr. The style of writing on the
paper may perhaps raise some question, and may possibly be found to
belong to the period of James I, when through his Queen and the
occasional presence of Christian IV in England, a considerable interest
was felt in matters connected with Denmark.”<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c020'><b>[271]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f271'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r271'>271</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Archæologia</i>, xl. p. 109. The date of her marriage
to Lorraine appears to have been 1540.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The inscription as it now is was probably painted over an earlier
one from Holbein’s brush, for it is too badly done to be original; but
there is no need to place it as late as Sir George suggests, for the
Lumley inventory speaks of her as the Duchess of Lorraine, so that
the alteration may have been due to Lord Lumley or his father-in-law.
It is even possible that Holbein may have placed no title of any kind
on the picture, but that the whole label was added by some other
painter employed for the purpose by the owner of Nonsuch.</p>

<p class='c023'>In spite of Henry’s admiration for the picture, the proposed match
came to nothing, though for some time Hutton continued to write
letters in her praises. Thus, on the 1st April 1538, he wrote to the
King:</p>

<p class='c023'>In the following month (May 17) he informed Wriothesley that

<p class='c023'>He added that he had presented the Regent with four couple of
young hounds and an ambling gelding, and had promised the same to
the Duchess, “wiche offre she gently acceptyd.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Early in June an obstacle to the match was suggested which proved
that the Emperor and his sister were only using the Duchess as a pawn
on the political chess-board, and that there was no real intention of
giving her to Henry. This obstacle was the fact that the Duchess was
a near kinswoman of the late Queen Katherine, Henry’s first wife, and
that the Pope’s dispensation was therefore necessary. The negotiations
dragged on throughout the year, Hutton suddenly dying in the
middle of them, on September 5, just when the King his master was
sending over two commissioners, Thomas Wriothesley, one of his
secretaries, and Stephen Vaughan, to treat personally with the Regent.
There is no need to record their adventures, or the manner in which
that lady continually put them off with plausible excuses. They
followed her about the country on her journey to Compiègne to meet
the King and Queen of France. On neither side was there any real
sincerity, but the Englishmen, although Dr. Edward Carne<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c020'><b>[274]</b></a> was sent
over to help them, could not score a point in the game. They had
several personal interviews with the Duchess, after one of which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>reported that “she is a godly personage, of stature hiegher thenne
eyther of us, a very good womans face, and competently faire, but

<p class='c023'>After another interview Wriothesley wrote to the King, on February
1, 1539:</p>

<p class='c025'>“A blinde man shuld judge no colours, but surely, Sir, after my
poure entendement, for that lyttel experyence that I have, she is

<div class='sidenote'>HISTORY OF THE PICTURE</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>This letter seems to indicate that there is no truth in the well-known
story told by Sandrart, and repeated by Walpole, that the
Duchess herself was not anxious to become Queen of England, telling
Henry’s ambassadors that “she had but one head; if she had two,
one of them should be at his Majesty’s service.” On the contrary,
Carne and his fellow-commissioners frequently mentioned that she
seemed bent on the alliance, and could not bear to hear of any other
marriage proposals. Among the frequenters of the English court it
was common gossip that she was very likely to be the next queen.
Thus, Robert Warner, of the Earl of Sussex’s household, writing to
Lord Fitzwater on November 21, 1538, tells him that “there is small
speaking of any queen; merely a report that it should be the duchess
of Milan. In any case it will be an outlandish woman and will not
happen till the spring.”<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c020'><b>[277]</b></a> There was also a report that the King had
sent her a diamond worth 16,000 ducats.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Early in 1539 Francis and Charles V were in full accord, and
Henry was making every possible preparation for war. The Regent
and the Emperor no longer attempted to keep up the farce of a possible
matrimonial alliance with England, though even then Wriothesley was
writing for Henry’s “phisnamy,” which he thought would make the
Duchess leave Emperor and all rather than be frustrated of so great
a match. In the end the three ambassadors departed for home on
March 19, though not without some trouble, as war appeared
imminent; and thus Holbein’s famous portrait remained as the only
record in Henry’s possession of these long and futile negotiations.</p>

<p class='c023'>The picture has never left England since the day it was painted.
It was in the possession of Henry VIII at the time of his death, and is
described in the inventory already mentioned, in which it is the
twelfth entry, as—“Item, a greate table with the picture of the
Duchyes of Myllayne, beinge her whole stature.” According to
Mr. Lionel Cust,<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c020'><b>[278]</b></a> it passed from King Henry’s collection to that of the
King’s cousin, Henry Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, after whose death it
belonged to his son-in-law, John, Lord Lumley, husband of the Earl’s
eldest daughter and co-heiress, Lady Joan Fitz-Alan. It is included
in the manuscript inventory of pictures and other objects of art
belonging to Lord Lumley in the reign of Queen Elizabeth already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>mentioned more than once. This inventory is entitled “A Certyficate
from Mr. John Lampton, Stewarde of Howseholde to John, Lord
Lumley, of all his Lo: Monumentes of Marbles, Pictures and tables
in Paynture, with other his Lordshippes Howseholde stuffe, and
Regester of Bookes. Anno 1590.” The picture is described as “The
statuary of the Duchess of Myllayne, afterwards Duches of Lorreyn
daughter to Christierne King of Denmarke doone by Haunce Holbyn,”
the word “statuary” being used for a standing whole-length figure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Against the contention that the picture passed directly from
Henry’s collection into the possession of the Earl of Arundel must
be placed Carel van Mander’s statement that in 1574 Zuccaro saw
it in the Earl of Pembroke’s house in London. “The said Zucchero,”
he says, “was also delighted with the portrait of a certain Countess,
dressed in black satin, life-size, a full-length figure, unusually pretty
and well painted by Holbein, and kept in Lord Pembroke’s house,
where he saw it in company with some painters and lovers of art,
and took such great delight in it, that he declared he had not seen its
like in art and delicacy even in Rome; therefore went away filled with
admiration.”<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c020'><b>[279]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f279'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r279'>279</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Woltmann, English translation, p. 426.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Van Mander’s book was not published until 1604, thirty years
later than this incident, and it is, of course, quite possible that either
he or Zuccaro made a mistake as to the ownership of the picture
and the place where it had been seen; but the statement is very
definite, and must be taken into consideration in tracing the portrait’s
history. In any case, there is no doubt that Lord Lumley owned it
in 1590, and that he was a lover of Holbein’s works, of which he
possessed a considerable number, most of which have been referred
to individually in preceding pages, among them the great cartoon of
Henry VII and Henry VIII belonging to the Duke of Devonshire,
and portraits of Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, and Sir Henry and Lady
Guideford, and the book of the Windsor drawings, all of which are
entered in the inventory as “drawne” or “doone” by “Haunce
Holbyn.” In Lord Lumley’s collection were also portraits of Sir
Nicholas Carew, Sir Thomas Lovell, the elder and the younger Sir
Thomas Wyat, and Sir Thomas Hennege, some of which also may
well have been by Holbein, though no artist’s name is placed against
them in the list.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HISTORY OF THE PICTURE</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>For many years Lord Lumley resided at Nonsuch. The erection
of this palace was begun by Henry VIII in the year in which the Duchess
was painted. The house, of which Toto was probably the chief architect
or decorator,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c020'><b>[280]</b></a> was unfinished at the King’s death, and remained
so during the reign of Edward VI; but in that of Mary it was completed
by the Earl of Arundel, who had become possessed of it, “after
the first intent and meaning of the said King his old maister.” Here
Lord Lumley resided with his wife and father-in-law until the Earl’s
death in 1580, when he became its owner. He added the front quadrangle,
and entertained Queen Elizabeth there on more than one
occasion. From his hands it reverted to the Crown in 1591 in exchange
for other property. No doubt Lord Lumley’s collection of
pictures remained at Nonsuch until that year, and very possibly the
inventory, dated 1590, was drawn up in preparation for the removal
of the works of art when this transfer of estates took place.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c020'><b>[281]</b></a></p>

<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xxxix. p. 35.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Upon the death of Lord Lumley without issue, it is evident that
the picture passed, with other portraits of the Fitz-Alan family, into
the possession of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, son of Thomas,
fourth Duke of Norfolk, and Lady Mary Fitz-Alan, younger daughter
and co-heiress of Henry, Earl of Arundel. Philip Howard was father
of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, probably the greatest art-collector
the world has ever known. When in the latter’s possession it was seen
by Sandrart, in 1627, who mentions it as the portrait of the King’s
“incomparable beloved one, a princess of Lorraine” (unvergleichlicher
Liebstin, einer Prinzessin von Lothringen). It was entered in the
Arundel inventory of 1655 as “Duchessa de Lorena grande del
naturale.”</p>

<p class='c023'>From that time until 1909 it remained in the possession of the
Howard family. Walpole adds to his <i>Anecdotes</i> a note to the effect
that “Vertue saw a whole length of this princess at Mr. Howard’s, in
Soho Square.”<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c020'><b>[282]</b></a> It was afterwards at Worksop Manor, then belonging
to the Duke of Norfolk, and later on was removed to Arundel
Castle, where it was described in the catalogue as “a very curious
portrait of a Duchess of Milan.” It was included in the exhibition
of Old Masters at Burlington House in 1880, and the Duke of Norfolk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>then lent it to the National Gallery, where it remained on loan for
nearly thirty years. About 1908 the Duke informed the Trustees
that he was receiving large offers for the picture, which he felt bound
to consider, but that he was most anxious that, if possible, it
should be secured for the nation; and he, therefore, gave an undertaking
that before closing with any purchaser he would first offer it
to the Gallery at the same price.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f282'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r282'>282</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Walpole, <i>Anecdotes</i>, ed. Wornum, p. 72.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>On April 22, 1909, his Grace told the authorities that he had
been offered a sum of £61,000, which he had accepted, subject to the
option granted to the National Gallery of purchasing at the same
price, and that the purchasers had consented to wait until May 1
for the completion of the transaction. As the Trustees were unable
to find so great a sum in so short a time, the Duke sold the picture
to Messrs. P. &amp; D. Colnaghi &amp; Co. for £61,000 on the latter date.
The purchasers then in turn offered it first of all to the nation, at the
enhanced price of £72,000, giving the Trustees a month in which to
raise the necessary fund. A determined effort to secure the picture
was then made by the chairman, Lord Balcarres, and committee of
the National Art-Collections Fund, but in spite of strenuous endeavours,
the amount subscribed up to within a few days of the expiration
of the time-limit fell far short of the great sum required.
Most happily, however, at the last moment a munificent anonymous
donor came forward with a gift of £40,000, which, with £10,000 from
the Government, and other subscriptions, including one from the
vendors, enabled the Fund to complete the purchase, and thus this
great picture, undoubtedly the finest portrait Holbein ever painted,
for which more than one millionaire collector was prepared to give
an even greater price for its possession, was saved for the English
nation, and has at last found a permanent home in the National
Gallery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF THE DUCHESS AS A CHILD</div>
<p class='c023'>It is interesting to note that this Duchess of Milan is identical
with the little dark-eyed girl wearing a peculiar hood in the well-known
picture of the three children of the King of Denmark by Mabuse,
in the English Royal Collection, now in Hampton Court. This picture
was engraved by Vertue in 1748, and was removed at that date from
Kensington Palace to Windsor. It was thought at that time—possibly
the mistake was Vertue’s—to represent the three children of Henry VII,
Prince Arthur, Prince Henry, and Princess Margaret, though in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Henry VIII’s catalogue they were correctly named as the “three
children of the Kynge of Denmarke.” The whole matter was cleared
up by Sir George Scharf in a paper read before the Society of Antiquaries
in 1860, and printed in <i>Archæologia</i>.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c020'><b>[283]</b></a> The original picture
appears to have been painted in the spring of 1526 at Malines, where
Mabuse was then engaged, amid other work, in restoring pictures for
the Lady Regent. From a letter from Sir Robert Wingfield to Wolsey,
written from that city on the 14th March 1526, we learn that the young
Prince of Denmark and his two sisters were then on a visit to their
aunt, “which be right goodly and fair children, specially the
daughters.”<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c020'><b>[284]</b></a> A letter from the Emperor to the Archduke Ferdinand,
of about the same date, also mentions this visit. “I am sorry to hear
of the death of the Queen of Denmark. Her children are with my
aunt in Flanders.”<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c020'><b>[285]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>In Charles I’s catalogue this picture was attributed to Janet (“a
Whitehall piece thought to be of Jennet”); and the earliest instance
of its rightful ascription to Mabuse is in the Commonwealth inventory,
among the pictures at St. James’s, where it is entered as: “Three
children in one piece by Mabuse, sold to Mr. Grinder for £10, 23rd
Oct. 1651.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Sir George Scharf, comparing this juvenile likeness with the one
painted by Holbein some thirteen years later, says: “The same
features and expression of countenance, notwithstanding the difference
of years, may be traced in both. The look of the eyes is quite the
same, and I would also invite attention to the form of the upper
eyelids which, especially in the Arundel picture, become remarkably
broad on the side away from the nose.”<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c020'><b>[286]</b></a> There are five or six replicas
of the Mabuse picture in this country, at Wilton, Sudeley Castle,
Longford Castle, Corsham House, and elsewhere. Other likenesses
of the Duchess are to be found on existing medals both of Sforza and
Lorraine, and in the fine engraving or etching of her by Agostino
Carracci, published in Campo’s <i>History of Cremona</i>.</p>

AS already stated in the last chapter, during the whole
of the time the negotiations for the hand of the
Duchess of Milan were in progress, others were being
carried on concurrently for a French bride for
Henry. The King’s personal inclination, indeed,
leant much more strongly towards an alliance with
France than one with the Emperor; and on October 24th, the
very day of Queen Jane Seymour’s death, Cromwell wrote to
Stephen Gardiner and Lord William Howard, then at the French
court, informing them of Henry’s loss, and urging them to make
secret inquiries as to a possible successor among the princesses of
France. “Our Prince,” he said, “our Lord be thanked, is in good
health, and suckethe like a child of his puissance, which youe, my Lord
William, canne declare. Our Mastres, thoroughe the faulte of them
that were about Her, whiche suffred Her to take greate cold, and to
eate things that her fantazie in syknes called for, is departed to God.”<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c020'><b>[288]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>He went on to say that the Council were unanimously of opinion
that the King should marry again as soon as possible:</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>THE DUCHESS OF LONGUEVILLE</div>
<p class='c030'>“Soo considering what personages in Christendom be mete for
Him, amonges the rest there be two in Fraunce, that may be thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>on, thone is the Frenche Kinges doughter (Margaret, afterwards
Duchess of Savoy), whiche, as it is said, is not the metest, the other
is Madame de Longevile, whom they say the King of Scottes dothe
desire. Of whose conditions and qualities in every pointe His Majeste
desireth you both, with all your dexterite and good meanes, to enquire;
and likewise in what pointe and termes the said King of Scottes
standeth towards either of them; whiche His Highnes is soo desirous
to knowe, His Graces desire therin to be nevertheles in any wise
kept secret to your selfes.”</p>

<p class='c027'>The details of the careful search which was made throughout
France for a suitable successor to Jane Seymour are to be found in
the very entertaining letters written by Louis de Perreau, Sieur de
Castillon, the French ambassador in London, to Francis I and his
Grand Master, Anne de Montmorency. The negotiations necessitated
the despatch of numerous envoys and messengers, and the painting of
four or five portraits; and there is very good evidence for the belief
that two or three of these were painted by Holbein, for which purpose
he made at least two journeys—to Le Havre in June 1538, and to
Joinville and Nancy at the end of the following August.</p>

<p class='c023'>In the first instance, Henry’s inclinations were very strongly set
upon Marie of Lorraine, the eldest daughter of Claude, Duke of Guise,
and the young widow of Charles d’Orléans, Duke of Longueville,
although she had been promised to James V of Scotland before Jane
Seymour’s death. Henry knew quite well that this arrangement had
been made, but he would not listen to the names of other ladies which
were suggested to him, and maintained with great pertinacity to
Castillon that the match with Scotland had not yet been settled, and
that Madame de Longueville had not herself agreed to it. “He is
so amorous of Madame de Longueville,” wrote Castillon to Francis,
on December 30, 1537, “that he cannot refrain from coming back
upon it.” “I asked him,” he goes on, “who caused him to be more
inclined to her than to others, and he said Wallop was so loud in her
praises that nothing could exceed them. Moreover, he said that he
was big in person, and had need of a big wife—that your daughter
was too young for him, and as to Madame de Vendosme, he would not
take the King of Scots’ leavings!”<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c020'><b>[289]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Either in December 1537 or early in the following January, Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>sent over Peter Mewtas, of the Privy Chamber, to see the Duchess
secretly, and to find out from her whether she considered herself
bound to James; and as a result of this mission he appears to have
convinced himself that, whatever Francis I might have arranged, the
lady herself and her parents were attracted by his offer, considering
an alliance with so powerful a sovereign to be preferred to one with the
“beggarly and stupid King of Scots,” as Henry termed his nephew
to Castillon. There was a political attraction, also, about the proposal,
from Henry’s point of view, for if he succeeded in taking James’s
bride from him it would tend to alienate the Scots from France.</p>

<p class='c023'>Formal articles of marriage, however, between the lady and
James V were drawn up in January; but in spite of this Henry stuck
to his point, and about the 1st of February Peter Mewtas was again
despatched by Cromwell to find out definitely if she were still free,
and also to obtain her portrait. The instructions given him need
not be quoted here. They concluded by saying that if he perceived
any towardness in the lady, he was, if possible, to get and bring with
him “her picture truly made and like unto her.”<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c020'><b>[290]</b></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>PIERRE QUESNEL AND HIS SONS</div>
<p class='c023'>Mewtas’ mission proved fruitless, and he was back in London
some time before the 6th March. There is no evidence to show that
he succeeded in obtaining a portrait of Madame de Longueville, or
that he took Holbein or any other painter with him for that purpose.
The Duchess seems to have been in Normandy, possibly at Longueville
or Le Havre, and it may have been left to Mewtas to obtain the
services of some local French painter, if such an one were to be procured.
It is more likely, however, that a painter would be taken
over for the purpose, though this was not mentioned in the instructions,
as it was in the case of Hoby’s mission to Brussels. If any one
were taken, it may have been Holbein, who was known personally to
Mewtas, for among the Windsor drawings there is one of the latter’s
wife.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c020'><b>[291]</b></a> This, however, is mere conjecture, and there is no evidence,
either in writing or in the shape of a drawing, to show that Holbein
took the portrait of this particular duchess; indeed, the fact of his
journey to the Netherlands seems to point to the contrary, for Mewtas
only returned to England from France early in March, so that if
Holbein had accompanied him, he would have had to start off again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>without a moment’s delay with Hoby in order to reach Brussels as
he did on the 10th of the same month. It was, of course, possible for
him to have made both journeys, but the interval between the two
was so short that extreme expedition would have been necessary.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>There was, however, a French painter, Pierre Quesnel, who may
possibly have been attached to Madame de Longueville’s court at the
time of Mewtas’ visit; in any case, he accompanied her to Edinburgh
two months later, and entered the service of James V. He came of a
family of portrait painters, and also practised historical painting.
His works are now unknown, but he returned to France in 1557, and
designed a painted window for the Augustins of Paris. He had three
sons, François, Nicolas, and Jacques. François,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c020'><b>[292]</b></a> who was born in
Holyrood about 1543 and died in 1619, was a portrait-painter of
exceptional ability, as may be seen from the fine portrait of “Mary
Ann Walker” belonging to Lord Spencer at Althorp Park, of which
an excellent reproduction in colour has been issued by the Medici
Society in their National Portrait Series. It is signed “F. Q.” in
monogram, and dated 1572. This picture was brought from France
about one hundred years ago, and was obtained from a descendant of
the lady’s family. In this connection it may be suggested that the
double portrait of “James V and Marie of Lorraine,”<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c020'><b>[293]</b></a> in the collection
of the Duke of Devonshire at Hardwick, may possibly have
been, in its original state, the production of the elder Quesnel’s brush.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c020'><b>[294]</b></a>
It must be noted, in conclusion, that there is no record in the English
State Papers of the result of Mewtas’ mission, and so it is doubtful
if Henry VIII ever possessed a portrait of the lady, whether by
Quesnel, or Holbein, or any other painter, such as Hornebolt, in the
King’s pay.</p>

<p class='c023'>Marie was married to the King of Scots on the 9th May, thus
putting a final end to Henry’s plans in that direction. In her place,
Francis offered him, through Castillon, the choice of any other lady
in his kingdom. He was told that “she had a sister as beautiful and
as graceful, clever and well-fitted to please and obey him as any other.”
This remark bore fruit, and the next morning the King sent Sir John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Russell, a member of his Privy Council, to make further inquiries.
Castillon told the latter that France was a warren of honourable ladies,
from which Henry might choose, and that Louise of Guise was the very
counterpart of Madame de Longueville. He had not seen her for a
long time, but had heard her esteemed above any other lady in the
kingdom. Russell then asked Castillon “to find some way that
Francis (to show it was not as a refusal that he could not have Madame
de Longueville, but because she was promised beforehand) should
offer him her sister, and say something of it to M. Briant (Sir Francis
Brian, Master of the Toils, then ambassador to France), who would
then send her portrait.”<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c020'><b>[295]</b></a> “Probably,” added Castillon, in writing to
Francis, “he is troubled that it must be known that his great instance
made for the one is so suddenly changed for the other.” Francis sent
word in reply (May 25) that he would very willingly conclude a
match with Henry and Louise of Guise; and on the 31st of the same
month Castillon wrote to the Grand Master, Montmorency, urging
greater expedition in the matter. “If he (Henry) is to marry in
France,” he said, “three or four must be put forward, but let them be
of the best and such as Montmorency shall advise as well to M. Brian
as in letters from the King to Castillon, who should also have portraits
of these put forward.”<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c020'><b>[296]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PROBABLE VISIT TO HAVRE</div>
<p class='c023'>The narrative may be broken off here to note that Holbein, who
remained in London throughout April and May, engaged, among other
things, upon the full-length portrait of the Duchess of Milan, received,
on the 29th of the latter month, the grant of a royal licence to export
“600 tuns of beer.” It runs as follows: “Hans Holbeyn, the King’s
servant. Licence to buy and export 600 tuns of beer. <i>Del.</i> Westminster,
29th May 30 Hen. VIII.”<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c020'><b>[297]</b></a> The painter was evidently prepared,
when the opportunity arose, to engage in small commercial
speculations in order to augment his income, as was the case with
more than one of his brother artists attached to Henry’s court. Thus,
in April 1531, Luke Hornebolt received a licence to export 400 quarters
of barley,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c020'><b>[298]</b></a> and Anthony Toto, “the King’s painter,” was granted one
in April 1541,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c020'><b>[299]</b></a> exactly similar to Holbein’s, for the exporting of 600 tuns
of beer. Again, Alard Plumier, “the King’s jeweller,” in March 1542,<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c020'><b>[300]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>obtained grants for importing 400 tuns of Toulouse woad and
Gascon wine, and exporting 400 tuns of beer; while, as already mentioned,
Holbein’s friend and compatriot, Niklaus Kratzer, the King’s
astronomer, received a very similar licence in October 1527.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c020'><b>[301]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Henry rose promptly to the bait of Louise of Guise as a wife in
place of her elder sister, now unattainable, and as usual no time was
wasted. On the 3rd of June he despatched Philip Hoby and a painter
to Havre to obtain the lady’s portrait. This we learn from a letter of
Castillon’s to Montmorency, dated June 4th, describing an interview
between the Duke of Norfolk and the ambassador’s “secretaire a
cachetter” respecting the suggested marriage, which concludes with
the following passage: “Finally he (Norfolk) said that yesterday he
(Henry) despatched the gentleman, who wanted to go to see” (“vouloit
aller”; Kaulek reads “souloit”) “Madame de Longueville, to Hâvre
de Grâce to see Mademoiselle de Guyse; for a Scotchman has come
hither who has said he wonders at the King of Scots taking a widow
rather than a young girl, her sister, the most beautiful creature that
ever he saw.”<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c020'><b>[302]</b></a> In the same letter Castillon again urges that portraits
of two or three of the ladies mentioned in his previous despatch should
be sent as quickly as possible, as the matter is pressing. In this
document there is no reference to Hoby by name, nor mention of any
painter accompanying him; nor is there any entry in the King’s
Book of Payments as to any expenses paid for such a journey either to
Hoby or any other special envoy. Hoby had paid a visit to France
earlier in the year in connection with his master’s matrimonial affairs.
He had been sent over in February, at about the same time as Mewtas,
and evidently, like the latter, for the purpose of urging Madame de
Longueville to throw over James V. For this expedition he received
exactly the same sum, £23, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, as for his journey to Brussels in the
following March. It is entered among the royal payments for February
as “Philip Hoby, sent into France about the King’s necessaries and
affairs of importance, £23, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>”<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c020'><b>[303]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>But although there is no record of payment for this second journey
in June to Havre, or mention of him by name, there is no doubt that
Hoby was the envoy sent, and that Holbein accompanied him.
Evidence of this is contained in a letter, quoted below,<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c020'><b>[304]</b></a> from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Duchess of Guise to her daughter Marie in Scotland, dated September 1,
which speaks of the arrival of Hoby and Holbein at Joinville, and
mentions their earlier visit to Havre. Contributory evidence is contained
in Castillon’s letter of June 4, in which he describes the
messenger sent as one who had already been over to see, or to try to
see, Madame de Longueville, which undoubtedly refers to Hoby’s
journey in February. According to the same letter from Joinville,
two portraits at least were painted at Havre, or rather studies made,
which would only occupy the artist for an hour or two, as in the
case of the Duchess of Milan, the sitters in question being Louise of
Guise, who was then eighteen, and some other lady—possibly Marie or
Margaret of Vendôme.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r304'>304</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See p. <a href='#Page_148'>148</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Somewhere about the date of Hoby’s return from Havre, a third
French candidate for Henry’s hand appeared upon the scene. This
was Renée, the third daughter of the Duke of Guise, who afterwards
became abbess of St. Pierre de Reims. Castillon wrote to Montmorency
on June 19: “If you wish to entertain this King urge
always the marriages; for he only waits for them to be presented, and
the pictures must be sent immediately. He has heard that Mons, de
Guyse has a daughter still more beautiful than the second. I hear she
is in a religious order, but not professed (<i>qu’elle est en une religion, mais
elle n’est pas religieuse</i>). You can say something of it to Mr. Bryant;
for he (Henry) expects to be asked and to have several offered to him.”<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c020'><b>[305]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>It will be seen from this letter that Castillon, who was probably
unaware of the steps Henry was taking to obtain likenesses by means
of his own artists, was doing his utmost, on his own account, to get
portraits of likely ladies sent over from France. In a later letter
(July 3) he harps upon the same theme. After reporting that
Henry is still in the best of humours, and is ready to meet Francis
at a house which he will have made between Boulogne and Calais,
where they can both stay for six or seven days without pomp or great
expense, he concludes by saying: “The principal point to bring him
over to the interests of Francis is that he take a wife in France, and
they must be more energetic than they have been, and let his ambassador
see and send portraits and write news; for he wishes to be sought,
and in the seeking they will put him so far in that he cannot draw
back.”<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c020'><b>[306]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>HENRY’S SEARCH FOR A BRIDE</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>In his reply, dated July 10, Montmorency stated that a portrait
of Louise of Guise had been obtained for Brian, who must have
already despatched it to England. “If the King does not decide upon
her,” he said, “others shall be shown to Brian.”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c020'><b>[307]</b></a> Castillon, who, on
account of the plague in London, was then living in Chelsea, in Sir
Thomas More’s old house, which had been lent to him by the King
for the summer, announced to Francis I on July 25 that Brian “has
sent the portrait of Mademoiselle de Guise, whom this King does not
think ugly, as I know by his face.”<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c020'><b>[308]</b></a> In spite, however, of Henry’s
appreciation of the lady’s charms, Castillon, in a letter to Montmorency
of the same date, urged that portraits of Mademoiselle de Vendôme and
the young de Guise (<i>i.e.</i> Renée) should be despatched with all

<p class='c023'>Throughout these negotiations Henry frequently suggested that a
selection of ladies should be brought to Calais for his personal approval,
in charge of Francis’ sister, Margaret of Navarre, or some other
high personage, such as the Duke of Guise. “The ladies he means,”
wrote Castillon to Francis on August 12, “are Mesdemoiselles de
Vendôsme, de Lorraine, and the two de Guise. He has heard something
of the younger of the two last, and I think he will settle on one
of them. He has a great opinion of their house.”<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c020'><b>[310]</b></a> This request of
Henry’s gave great offence in France, which was voiced in a letter
from Montmorency to Castillon on July 29: “To bring him thither
(<i>i.e.</i> to Calais), as he asks, young ladies to choose and make them
promenade on show! They are not hackneys to sell, and there would
be no propriety in it. Henry has his choice of Mdlle. de Vendosme,
or Mdlle. de Guise, and can judge of their beauty by the portraits and
reports made to him; and if these be not approved, there are many
other ladies from whom to choose. The selection might be left to his
ambassador, Briant, who could send portraits.”<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c020'><b>[311]</b></a> Even this did not
quell the King, and in the end he was informed that Lorraine was not
under the sway of Francis, and that he would have to apply for the
hand of the damsel (Anne of Lorraine) to her father and mother, and
as for the two daughters of Guise, one had already professed as a nun,
while the other, as well as the daughter of M. de Vendosme, could not
be disposed of as though they were on sale.</p>

<p class='c023'>This official portrait of Louise of Guise by some French painter,
which Brian sent over—and possibly a second one of Marie of Vendôme,
as may be inferred from the last quoted letter—must not be confused
with those privately procured by Hoby at Havre in June. These
later French portraits cannot now be traced, and it would be mere
guesswork to attempt to name the artist who was employed to produce
them; but a careful search through the royal collections or in some
of the older houses in England might possibly result in their discovery.</p>

<p class='c023'>Some time in August Holbein and Hoby set out together upon
their journey “into the parties of high Burgony.” The purpose
of their expedition was to obtain portraits of Renée of Guise, the
Duke’s third daughter, and of her cousin, Anne of Lorraine, while
Hoby was to sound the latter’s father as to his inclinations towards a
possible marriage between his house and England. Hoby’s instructions
from Cromwell, as given in abstract in the State Papers, run as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“‘A memorial [by Cromwell] to my friend Philip Hoby touching
such matters as he hath now committed to his charge.’</p>

<p class='c030'>“To repair with diligence where the young duke of Longueville
lies, where he shall find the two daughters of Mons, de Guyse, whom
he shall salute, declaring that having business in these parts he could
not omit to visit the one of them ‘of whom he hath by his late being
there some acquaintance.’ And therewith he shall view well the
younger sister, and shall require the Duchess, her mother, or whoever
has the government of them, that he may take the physiognomy of
her, that he may join her sister and her in a fair table. Which obtained,
he shall go to the duke of Lorraine, deliver my letter of credence,
and declare that no doubt he has heard of my good will to advance some
personage of his house to the marriage of the King my master; and
albeit my purpose has not taken the effect I desired, yet my affection
remains the same; and learning lately that his Grace has a daughter
of excellent quality, I directed the said Philip, who has other affairs
there, to see her and get her picture. Requiring him to show his inclination
and devise some overture to the King, upon which I may set
forth this thing. Philip shall also speak in the same manner to the
young lady. As soon as he has gotten her physiognomy and known
the Duke’s pleasure he shall return with all possible diligence.”<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c020'><b>[312]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>JOURNEY TO JOINVILLE AND NANCY</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>When Marie of Guise married James V of Scotland she left her son
François, Duke de Longueville, behind her in charge of his maternal
grandmother, Anthoinette of Bourbon, Duchess of Guise, who throughout
1538 was at Joinville, one of the chief residences of the family,
or at places in the immediate neighbourhood. Joinville is a small
town in Champagne, situated on the Marne between Chaumont and
Saint-Dizier, and was made a principality by Henri II in 1552 in favour
of Duke Claude’s eldest son, François II of Guise. Mary Queen of
Scots resided there for some time when a young girl, under the care of
her maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Guise. Miss Jane T.
Stoddart, in her recently-published book, <i>The Girlhood of Mary Queen
of Scots</i>, describes Joinville as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“The train from Bar-le-Duc passes through a fertile, well-wooded
country, with many sparkling streams and closely planted villages.
There are few more picturesquely situated towns in Eastern France
than Joinville, which lies on a branch of the Marne, in a valley overshadowed
by undulating tree-clad heights, on one of which, until
near the end of the eighteenth century, stood the Castle of the Guises....
The woods of Joinville to-day are full of singing birds. Every
variety of foliage clothes the deep ravines. The high road leading
towards Wassy is fringed with innumerable small, well-kept gardens,
and the air, on May evenings, is not only light and bracing, but sweet
with the scent of flowers. The little town must have changed very
much in appearance since the sixteenth century. It once possessed
a wall and three gates, and an old map in the Hôtel de Ville shows
more than a dozen spires.... It acquired great importance under
the first Dukes of Guise, who used it as their habitual country residence,
and entertained royal personages in the Castle with regal
magnificence. That proud Castle was allowed to fall into ruins during
the eighteenth century.... The picturesque quays near the church,
where the grass-impeded Marne runs between rows of tall, irregularly
built houses, cannot have altered greatly since Queen Mary’s time. In
unexpected corners we find whitewashed houses adorned with old and
costly sculptor’s work, with carved pillars, and scrolls of vine-leaves
surrounding the porch.”<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c020'><b>[313]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>For Joinville, then, the diplomatist and the artist set out about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>the middle of August. The journey was a long one, and Hoby received
in advance for travelling expenses, £66, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, nearly three
times as much as he had been paid for his earlier journeys to Havre
and Brussels, thus showing that the expedition was to be of considerably
longer duration. This payment is entered in the royal accounts
under August, anno 30, and is undated, but as may be gathered from
entries preceding and following it, it was on some day between August
11 and 22. The place of destination is not mentioned; Hoby
is said merely to be “sent into the parts of beyond the sea with all
diligence.”<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c020'><b>[314]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>All the information so far to be gained about this journey is contained
in a letter from the Duchess of Guise to her daughter in Scotland,
dated September 1, which is preserved among the Balcarres MSS.
in the Advocates’ Library in Edinburgh. From it we learn that the
two travellers reached Joinville on August 30. The letter begins
by describing the health of the youthful Duke of Longueville, who was
not quite three years old, and was growing very tall and plump, and
goes on to give an account of the illnesses of various members of the
family. Louise was still ill of the fever, and had not moved from her
bed for eight days. Her brother Claude had been ill, even to death,
at Autun, but was now quite out of danger. “Your sister Anthoinette
is also ill of a fever and of a rheum, but I think she will do well. Your
aunt (the Duchess of Lorraine) is sent for to be at Court at the coming
of the Queen of Hungary, who is to be presently at Compiègne, where
the King and all the Court will be in a few days.”</p>

who was at Havre and the painter were here. The gentleman came

report news of her to the King his master. He saw her (it was the day
of her fever), and talked with her as he had done to me. He then told
me that, being so near Lorraine, he wished to go to Nency to see the
country. ‘Je me doute (doubtai) in contynent il y allet voir la

<p class='c023'>This letter fully bears out Cromwell’s instructions to Hoby. It is
plain from its wording that Hoby had already obtained a portrait of
Louise at Havre, and at least one other, of some unnamed lady (“pour
la tirer comes <i>les aultres</i>”); and that the painter who had drawn
them was the painter now at Joinville. Their journey was, however,
in part at least, a failure, for their chief purpose in visiting the Duchess
was to obtain a portrait of her daughter Renée, the “religieuse.”
Hoby was ordered “to take the physiognomy of her, that he may join
her sister and her in a fair table”; in other words, he was to get a
drawing of the younger girl in order that her portrait might be painted
as a companion to the one of her sister Louise already completed, so
that they might be hung side by side in one of those double frames
hinged together of which Henry VIII had several in his collection.
Unfortunately for their purpose, Renée was not at Joinville, so that
nothing could be done, and Hoby had to be content with an interview
with Louise in her bedchamber. The fourth daughter, Anthoinette,
was at home, but she was then only a child of seven. Thanks to the
curiosity of the Duchess, however, we know that they succeeded in
the second half of their mission. They spent a day at Nancy, where
they were well received by the Duke of Lorraine, and evidently procured
the drawing required, which Holbein would easily make in a few
hours. Hoby attempted to conceal the real purpose of this visit to
Nancy from the Duchess of Guise, but the lady was sharp enough to
guess what was in the wind. Whether Louise or Anne, however, it
was all in the family. “If the worst comes to the worst,” she tells
the Queen of Scots, “if you do not have your sister for neighbour,
it may well be your cousin.”</p>

<p class='c023'>The letter is far from easy to decipher, owing to its extraordinary
spelling and grammar. It is difficult to gather from it which of the
two places Hoby and his companion first visited. The Duchess,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>writing only two days after they had been with her, says that the
envoy told her that “he wished to go to Nency,” which seems to
indicate a prospective journey; but, on the other hand, she says “they
have been to Nency,” and a journey from Joinville to Nancy and
back again, together with a whole day spent at the latter place, could
not possibly have been accomplished between August 30 and
September 1, so that it looks as though they had gone straight to
the Duke of Lorraine in spite of Cromwell’s instructions, and then
from there on to Joinville. The point, however, is of little importance.</p>

<p class='c023'>Neither in Cromwell’s instructions nor the Duchess’s letter is
Holbein mentioned by name, but that he was the painter who accompanied
Hoby seems certain. In less than a fortnight afterwards he
was in Basel, an easy journey from Lorraine, where he made a stay
of at least some weeks, returning to England some time before Christmas,
when he received from the royal purse a special reward of £10 for
his journey into “high Burgony.” The entry runs as follows:
“December, A<b>o</b> xxx:—Item payde to Hans Holbyn, one of the Kingis
paynters, by the Kingis commaundement, certefyed by my Lorde
pryviseales lettre, x <i>li.</i> for his costis and chargis at this
tyme sent aboute certeyn his gracis affares into the parties of high
Burgony, by way of his Graces rewarde, x <i>li.</i>”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c020'><b>[316]</b></a></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r316'>316</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>C.L.P.</i>, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 1280 (f. 48).</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Wornum and other writers have assumed that this journey to
High Burgundy had to do with the painting of the portrait of the
Duchess of Milan. The former even suggests that the £10 might be a
deferred payment for the visit to Brussels in March.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c020'><b>[317]</b></a> But the title
“High Burgony” was quite appropriate to the district in which
Joinville and Nancy are situate. Woltmann says that High Burgundy
was the name given to the county of Burgundy (Franche Comté),
which belonged to the Emperor, in distinction to the duchy of Burgundy,
which was French, and added that, in those days, the denomination
would not have been impossible for Switzerland.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c020'><b>[318]</b></a> It may be
taken, therefore, considering the lack of accurate geographical knowledge
then existing in England, that the expression “High Burgony”
sufficiently indicated, in the mind of the keeper of the royal accounts,
that part of the world in which Guise and Lorraine had their headquarters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE PAYMENT OF HOLBEIN’S SALARY</div>
<p class='c023'>That the payment of this special reward to Holbein—his travelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and other expenses would be included in the sum of £66, 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> paid to Hoby—was deferred until Christmas was owing to the
fact that, finding himself so near Switzerland when at Joinville, he
seized the opportunity of paying a visit to his family in Basel, and
so remained absent from England for about three months in all. Another
point in favour of the contention that Holbein was abroad on the
King’s business during 1538 more often than has been generally
supposed, is to be found in the fact that at the Midsummer quarter he
received three-quarters of a year’s salary in advance. At Lady Day he
had been paid his customary quarter’s salary: “Lady Day, Anno
xxix:—Item for Hans Holben, paynter, vii <i>li.</i> x<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p class='c023'>At Midsummer he received £30, a whole year’s salary, but it included
the quarter from Lady Day then owing to him. The entry
reads: “Midsummer, Anno xxx:—Item for Hans Holbyn, paynter,
for one hole yere’s annuitie advaunced to him beforehand the same
yere, to be accomptedde from o<b>r</b> Ladye dey last past, the somme of
xxx <i>li.</i>”</p>

<p class='c023'>On the two following quarter-days, owing to this payment in
advance, he is entered as receiving nothing:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Michaelmas, A<b>o</b> xxx:—Item for Hans Holbyn, paynter, wages
nihil<b>a</b> quia solutum per warrantum.” “Christmas, A<b>o</b> xxx:—Item
for Hans Holbyn, paynter, Nihil.”</p>

<p class='c027'>This payment in advance has generally been regarded as a mark
of the King’s special favour and as an acknowledgment of his talents
as an artist, but it was more probably due to his frequent absences
from England at that time. On the one hand, his several journeys
might well entail some amount of extra expenditure not covered by
his travelling allowances, while on the other his income would be
reduced through the limited time left him for painting the portraits
of English courtiers or German merchants. There is, in fact, no
portrait from his brush bearing the date 1538. Added to this, his
great success in painting the Duchess of Milan must be taken into
account. The King was delighted with this portrait, and his choice
would naturally fall upon the man who had painted it when a similar
journey was in contemplation.</p>

<p class='c023'>There is one piece of evidence, however, against the assumption
that Holbein was the painter who went to Joinville, which must not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>be overlooked—a letter from Niklaus Kratzer, the King’s astronomer,
to Cromwell. It is a much-mutilated epistle, written in somewhat
halting and incorrect Latin. Kratzer begins by saying that he had
received, the day before writing, by a ship from Antwerp, two little
books by Georgius Spalatinus, which the author had sent to him in
order that he might present them to Cromwell. “These,” he says, “I
gave to Hans Holbein (Joanni Holbein), in order that he might give
them to you.” At first sight this looks as though Kratzer might have
given Holbein the books to deliver, knowing that he was about to visit
Cromwell for final instructions on the eve of his departure for High
Burgundy. The letter,<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c020'><b>[319]</b></a> however, is dated St. Bartholomew’s Day,
August 24 (Datum Lunduni, in [festo Sancti] Bartholomei), so that
if Kratzer had seen Holbein on August 23, the latter could not
possibly have reached Joinville by the 30th; for although the King’s
messengers were accustomed to travel with great expedition—Castillon
complains to Montmorency that the English couriers took only five
or six days between Paris and London, whereas the French messengers
took double that time—it would have been impossible, even with the
utmost speed then attainable, to reach the far borders of eastern
France within a week. But although the letter is dated “St. Bartholomew’s
Day,” it has no year-date. It has been placed under the
year 1538 by the editor of the <i>Calendars of Letters and Papers</i> from
such internal evidence in it as it is possible to decipher; but it is so
badly mutilated that it is impossible to make much sense of the greater
part of it. It contains news from abroad, and mentions Burgratus,
vice-chancellor of the Duke of Saxony; and Burgratus was certainly in
London in the summer of 1538, with other envoys from the German
Protestant princes. These envoys, however, paid more than one
visit to England. As, therefore, the letter contains no evidence
absolutely conclusive of the date 1538, it may, perhaps, be permitted
to hold the opinion that it was written in some other year, and that,
by itself, it is not sufficient to negative the strong proofs brought
forward to show that Holbein was the painter who made this particular
journey into France. Nor was this the only occasion on which
Spalatinus used Kratzer as the medium for sending copies of his
writings to Cromwell. On February 5, 1539, Cromwell wrote to the King,
enclosing “a book brought this morning by Nic. Cratzer, astronomer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>which Geo. Spalatinus, some time schoolmaster to the duke of Saxony,
desired him to deliver to the King, on ‘The Solace and Consolation
of Princes.’”<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c020'><b>[320]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE DATE OF HOBY’S INSTRUCTIONS</div>
<p class='c023'>One other point in connection with this subject must be mentioned
before leaving it. Hoby’s instructions for visiting the courts of the
Duchess of Guise and the Duke of Lorraine are not dated. The editor of
the <i>Calendars</i> has entered them under February 1538, together
with the very similar instructions for the visit to the Duchess of
Milan, which are also undated, placing both under the one heading,
“Philip Hoby’s Missions.” For the latter instructions, which he puts
second, February is, of course, the correct date, but the former
should be under August, as the preceding pages prove. Dr. Gairdner was
misled, in the first place, by the fact that in February Hoby received
payment from the royal purse for a journey to France, and, in the
second, through his misreading of the heading to the Brussels
instructions, as
explained in the last chapter.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c020'><b>[321]</b></a> By the insertion of two unnecessary
words,<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c020'><b>[322]</b></a> the last-named instructions are made to read as though it
was Cromwell’s intention that Hoby, on this particular journey,
should go first of all to the Duchess of Lorraine, and then to the Duchess
of Milan. He concludes from this, in his preface to vol. xiii. pt. i.
of the <i>Calendars of Letters and Papers</i>, that Hoby went to France in
February for the purpose of obtaining the portraits of Marie of Guise
and her sister Louise in a single picture, and immediately upon his
return set out for Brussels to get one of the Duchess of Milan. There
is no need to quote the whole of his argument, as it is based upon a
misapprehension, for the instructions in question were undoubtedly
drawn up in August, as the letter of the Duchess of Guise, of the
1st of September, clearly proves.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c020'><b>[323]</b></a></p>

</div>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f323'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r323'>323</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After pointing out that the instructions order Hoby to
return home at once after obtaining portraits of the two Guises and
the daughter of the Duke of Lorraine, he continues: “Yet instructions
for his proceeding on another very similar mission seem to have been
drawn up at or near the same time; and by these second instructions he
was not to come home at all, but proceed at once from the duchess of
Lorraine in France to the duchess of Milan in the Netherlands. It
would seem, however, that the heading to the second set of
instructions has been supplied by a transcriber of a later date, and
it is clearly inaccurate.” <i>C.L.P.</i>, vol. xiii. pt. i., preface,
p. xxxviii.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In spite of this anxiety to obtain portraits, Henry’s negotiations
for a French marriage were as unsuccessful as his advances for the hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of the Duchess of Milan. In each case, no doubt, the proposed alliance
was largely political, though Henry seems to have been genuinely
anxious to marry Madame de Longueville, or to prevent his nephew of
Scotland from doing so, and was afterwards by no means unwilling
to take one of her sisters. Throughout the whole proceedings the
French and the Imperial ambassadors in London kept each other well
informed of what was going on, though each one was of the private
opinion that Henry was more inclined towards a bride from his country
than from the other’s. Thus Chapuys, writing to Charles V early in
1539, reports that “everybody says he is much inclined to the duchess
of Milan, whom, as I was informed three days ago, by one who knows
almost all secrets, he would willingly take, even if she were delivered
to him naked without a penny.”<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c020'><b>[324]</b></a> On the other hand, Castillon told
Montmorency: “He, however, says the practice of his marriage with
the duchess of Milan still continues, ... but I know he would
willingly return to marry Mademoiselle de Guise. If you think the
King (Francis) and Emperor should have the pastime of seeing him
thus ‘virolin virolant,’ I can easily get it up, provided a little good
cheer is made to his ambassador, and that M. le Cardinal or M. de Guise
caress him a little.”<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c020'><b>[325]</b></a> Henry, however, finally turned his attentions
in another direction, while two of the ladies he had sought were soon
married elsewhere, Louise of Guise to Charles de Croi, Prince de Chimaix,
in 1541, and Anne of Lorraine to René, Prince of Orange, in 1540.
The third, Marie of Vendôme, died unmarried, aged twenty-two, on
28th September 1538, a week or two after Holbein was at Joinville.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c020'><b>[326]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S MOVEMENTS IN 1538</div>
<p class='c023'>Whether Holbein painted pictures of one or all of these ladies from
the drawings he made in France it is impossible to say. The drawings
themselves cannot be traced, but this does not prove that they were
not taken, for the preliminary studies of Christina of Milan and of
Anne of Cleves and her sister Amelia have so far remained undiscovered.
Holbein and Hoby parted company at Nancy early in September,
the former to visit his wife and family in Basel, while the latter returned
post-haste to London, no doubt taking with him Holbein’s sketch of
Anne of Lorraine in order to show it to his royal master. In October
Hoby set out for Spain, in connection with the negotiations for the
Milan marriage.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The contents of this chapter and the preceding one may be
summarised as follows:</p>

<p class='c033'><i>February 1, 1538.</i>—Peter Mewtas sent over to France to obtain
the portrait of Marie of Lorraine, Duchess of Longueville. Early in
the same month Philip Hoby was also sent into France for the same
purpose (about the King’s “necessaries and affairs of importance”),
for which he was paid £23, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>
<p class='c034'><i>March 2 or 3, 1538.</i> —Hoby and Holbein left London for Brussels
to obtain the portrait of the Duchess of Milan, reaching the latter
place on the evening of the 10th.</p>
<p class='c034'><i>March 12, 1538.</i>—Holbein made his drawing of the Duchess, and
the two men started home on the evening of the same day, reaching
London on March 18.</p>
<p class='c034'><i>April and May 1538.</i>—Holbein at work on the full-length portrait
of the Duchess of Milan.</p>
<p class='c034'><i>May 29, 1538.</i>—Holbein received a royal licence to export 600
tuns of beer.</p>
<p class='c034'><i>June 3, 1538.</i>—Hoby and Holbein left London for Havre to obtain
the portrait of Louise of Guise, and of some other lady, possibly
Marie or Margaret of Vendôme.</p>
<p class='c034'><i>June 30, 1538.</i>—Holbein received three-quarters of a year’s
salary in advance.</p>
<p class='c034'><i>August 11-22, 1538.</i>—On one of the days between these dates Hoby
and Holbein left London for Nancy and Joinville to obtain portraits of
Renée of Guise and Anne of Lorraine, receiving £66, 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> for their travelling expenses. They arrived at Joinville on
August 30, to find Renée absent, but were successful at Nancy in
getting a likeness of Anne. From Joinville Hoby returned to London,
and Holbein went on to Basel, which he reached before September 10. He
remained there until after October 16.</p>
<p class='c034'><i>December 1538.</i>—Holbein, upon his return to London, received a
special reward of £10 “for his costis and chargis at this tyme sent

SOME nine days after Hoby and Holbein parted company
at Nancy the latter was home again in Basel after
an absence of six years.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c020'><b>[327]</b></a> The journey across the
Vosges mountains would not be a long one. On
September 12, 1538, Rudolph Gwalther, then studying
in Basel, wrote to the antistes Heinrich Bullinger in
Zürich: “Hans Holbein came recently to Basel from England, and
he gives such a glowing account of the happy condition of that kingdom,
that after a few weeks’ stay he means to go back again.”<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c020'><b>[328]</b></a>
He received a very hearty welcome from the citizens, who, now
that his reputation was much more than a local one, were naturally
proud of the fact that he was one of themselves. On September 10
his fellow-burghers gave a banquet in his honour in the Guild-house
in the St. Johanns-Vorstadt, the quarter of the city in which
Holbein’s own residence was situated. Matthäus Steck, the steward
of the Dominican Monastery, notes in his Book of Accounts that
he and the schoolmaster, Brother Jacob, with their wives, were
present on the occasion, and that they spent eight shillings.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f327'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r327'>327</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unless, as suggested above (see p. 63), he had paid an
earlier visit to Basel, about 1534-5, of which, however, there is no
actual evidence.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f328'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r328'>328</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Venit nuper Basileam ex Anglia Johannes Holbein, adeo
felicem ejus regni statum praedicans, qui aliquot septimanis exactis
rursum eo migraturus est.” This letter, which was first quoted by
Hegner (<i>Hans Holbein der Jüngere</i>, p. 246), is now among the
Zürich State Papers in the Antistical Archives.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>PROPOSAL TO REPAINT WALL-PAINTINGS</div>
<p class='c023'>There is a most interesting reference to this home-coming in Dr.
Ludwig Iselin’s additions to the Faesch manuscript (discovered by Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>His-Heusler), in which he says: “When he returned to Basel for a
time from England, he was attired in silk and velvet; before this he
was obliged to buy wine at the tap.”<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c020'><b>[329]</b></a> In Basel, a city where wine
was both cheap and plentiful, and all men of means kept a well-stocked
cellar, to be obliged to procure it, from day to day, from the tavern
was a sign of poverty, and Iselin thus contrasts Holbein’s worldly
condition before leaving Switzerland and after his entry into the
service of Henry VIII. Iselin adds, after stating that Holbein died
soon after his return to England, that “his intention was, had God
lengthened his life, to paint many of his pictures again, at his own
expense, as well as the apartment in the Town Hall. The house
‘zum Tanz,’ he said, was ‘rather good.’” The pictures which he
wished to put in order were, of course, his wall-paintings on the exterior
of several of the Basel houses, done in his youth, some eighteen
years earlier, which even then were beginning to suffer from exposure
to the weather, and his frescoes in the Town Hall, some of which were
already damaged by damp. No doubt, too, he felt that he could
improve upon them, though it is interesting to note that he expressed
himself satisfied with the “House of the Dance” façade, in which he
had given the freest play to his imagination.</p>

<p class='c023'>Twice during his absence in England, on November 23, 1533, and
January 7, 1537, he had been “laid out for the banneret” by his
Guild “zum Himmel”—that is, appointed as one of those who had to
perform the military service of the Guild, but he had ignored the
summons.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c020'><b>[330]</b></a> Possibly he knew nothing about it. He had even disregarded
the letter from the burgomaster, sent to him in September
1532, shortly after his return to England, in spite of the offer of a
pension which it contained; for England afforded far better opportunities
than Switzerland for the making of money.</p>

<p class='c023'>The two items, from the Banner Book of the Guild “zum Himmel,”

“Hanns Holbein der maller.”<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c020'><b>[331]</b></a></p>

Archive</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The first entry is brought forward by Mr. W. F. Dickes as one of the
strongest pieces of evidence in favour of his contention that Holbein
obeyed the request contained in the Burgomaster’s letter, and returned
to Basel in the winter of 1532, and remained there throughout the
following year, so that he could not have painted “The Ambassadors”
in England in 1533. He entirely misreads the entry, however, which
he regards as a record “of monies due to Holbein for festal decorations
on behalf of the two city guilds”<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c020'><b>[332]</b></a> (Von Himmel und von Sternen);
and he ignores the second entry, which, to be logical, should prove
that Holbein was also in Basel in January 1537. No “monies” are
entered against these items, as one would gather from his description,
so that it is difficult to see how they record sums due to the painter.
They were merely lists of names, as Woltmann points out,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c020'><b>[333]</b></a> of members
of the Guilds appointed to take their turn of military service on festal
occasions. The second entry shows this even more clearly than the
first, and from it we learn that Holbein was one of thirteen members
thus appointed as banner-bearers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>OFFERED PENSION BY BASEL COUNCIL</div>
<p class='c023'>It is probable that one of the chief reasons for Holbein’s visit to
Basel, in addition to a natural desire to see his family, was to make
some arrangement with the Town Council for a further leave of absence.
He was now in the actual service of a foreign sovereign, and
he ran the risk of losing his rights of citizenship unless he could come
to some understanding with the civic authorities. He had taken,
as we have seen, no notice of the Council’s urgent request, sent after
him to England in the autumn of 1532, and he had ignored the calls
made upon him by the Painters’ Guild during the six years of his
absence, for fulfilling his share of various official and ceremonial duties.
Probably he was quite unaware that such calls had been made. Now,
however, that he was in Henry VIII’s pay, it was necessary that some
definite arrangement should be made, which would enable him to
remain in England at least some years longer without risk of unpleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>consequences. The Council, seeing that he had become a
painter of high reputation, known far beyond the confines of Switzerland,
were more anxious than ever to keep him in Basel. Aware,
however, that they were not rich enough to find him employment as
remunerative as that enjoyed by him at the English court, they
effected a compromise. A document was drawn up, after consultation
with the painter, in which a much more generous offer was made
to him than the one proposed in 1532. This agreement, which was
signed on behalf of the Council by Jakob Meyer, “zum Hirschen,”
after extolling Holbein’s reputation as a painter, offered him a pension
of fifty gulden a year, with permission to remain in England for two
years longer, during which time they would pay his wife a pension of
forty gulden. After his final return to Basel, he was still to be permitted
to receive service money from foreign kings, princes, nobles,
and cities, and, in order to sell his pictures, was to be allowed to
visit France, England, Milan, or the Netherlands once, twice, or thrice
a year for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c023'>The document runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Master Hans Holbein the painter’s Pension.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“We, Jacob Meyger, Burgomaster, and the Council of the city of
Basel, do make known and acknowledge with this letter that:</p>

<p class='c030'>“From the special and favourable will which we bear to the
honourable Hans Holbein, the painter, our dear citizen, since he is
famous beyond other painters on account of the wealth of his art;
weighing further that in matters belonging to our city respecting
building affairs and other things which he understands, he can aid
us with his counsel, and that in case we had to execute painting work
on any occasion, he should undertake the same, for suitable reward,
we have therefore consented, arranged, and pledged to give and to
present to the above-named Hans Holbein a free and right pension
from our treasury of fifty gulden, though with the following conditions,
and only during his lifetime, whether he be well or ill, yearly,
in equal parts at the four quarters.</p>

<p class='c030'>“As however the said Hans Holbein has now sojourned for some
time with the King’s Majesty in England, and according to his declaration
it is to be feared that he can scarcely quit the Court for the
next two years, we have allowed him under these circumstances to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>remain in England the two years following this date, in order to merit
a gracious discharge, and to receive salary, and have consented during
these two years to pay his wife residing among us forty gulden yearly,
<i>i.e.</i> ten gulden quarterly, which are to begin from next Christmas, as
the end of the first quarter. With the addition that in case Hans
Holbein should receive his discharge from England within these two
years and should return to us at Basel and remain here, that we should
from that moment give him his pension of fifty gulden, and let it be
paid to him in equal parts at the end of the quarter. And, as we can
well imagine that the said Holbein, with his art and work being of so
far more value than that they should be expended on old walls and
houses, cannot with us alone reap much advantage, we have therefore
allowed the said Holbein, that, unimpeded by our agreement, for the
sake of his art and trade, and for no other unlawful and crafty matters,
as we have also impressed upon him, he may gain, accept, and receive
service money from foreign kings, princes, nobles, and cities; that
moreover he may convey and sell the works of art which he may execute
here once, twice, or thrice a year, each time with our special permission,
and not without our knowledge, to foreign gentlemen in France,
England, Milan, and the Netherlands. Yet on such journeys, he may
not remain craftily abroad, but on each occasion he shall do his
business in the speediest manner, and repair home without delay and
be serviceable to us, as we have before said, and as he has promised.</p>

<p class='c030'>“In conclusion, when the oft-mentioned Holbein has paid the
debt of nature according to the will of God, and has departed from
this valley of tears, then shall this warrant, pension, and present
letter be at an end, and we and our descendants therefore are not
pledged to give aught to anyone. All upright, honourable, and with
integrity. This letter, signed with our official seal, we have given
into the hand of the oft-mentioned Holbein as a true document.

<div class='sidenote'>DEATH AND WILL OF SIGMUND HOLBEIN</div>
<p class='c023'>This document shows very clearly that though the civic authorities of
Basel were anxious to retain Holbein in their service, they were
doubtful whether they would be able to find much work for him except
in the direction of an occasional wall-painting or decoration of a
house-front; and his talents, they acknowledged, were too great to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>devoted to nothing but the covering of “old walls and houses” with
designs. They, therefore, made many concessions, which would
enable him to pursue his art with almost the same freedom he had
hitherto enjoyed. In spite of the liberality of the terms, however,
the document remained, as far as Holbein was concerned, a dead
letter throughout the five remaining years of his life; at least, no
evidence has so far been discovered to show that he ever visited Basel
again, though, as suggested in an earlier chapter,<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c020'><b>[335]</b></a> he may have done
so about the year 1541. Whether his wife received the pension of
40 gulden for the first two years is not known. There is no mention
of it in the Council’s accounts, but Woltmann suggests that it may
have been given, as was often the case with pensions of this kind, out
of the monastery revenues.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f335'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r335'>335</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Holbein was bound to return to England for at least another
six months, as he had received nine months’ salary in advance, but
there can be little doubt that he had, at the time, every intention of
accepting the Council’s conditions. He was, however, so popular in
England, and had so much work on hand, that he found it increasingly
difficult to leave, so that in the end his arrangement with the Basel
Council fell to the ground. It has been suggested, too, that the death
of his uncle Sigmund in Berne, in November 1540, at about the time
when Holbein was due to return to Basel, may have had something to
do with his determination to remain in England; for Sigmund bequeathed
all his property to his “dear brother’s son Hans,” and it was
handed over to the latter’s wife in his absence. The will, from which
we learn that “Sigmund Holbeyn” was then a citizen of Berne, and
being old, was about to make a journey to Augsburg to see his relations,
continues:</p>

<p class='c025'>“In the first place, I will and bequeath to my dear brother’s son
Hans Holbeyn, the painter, citizen at Basel, both as my blood relation
and my own race and name, as well as from the especial love I bear him
and from the affinity in which he stands to me, the free gift of all my
goods and property which I have and leave in the city of Berne,
namely, my house, and courtyard, and the garden behind, standing
in the Brunnengasse, on the sunny side, above by the Trom Wall,
near Görg Zimmerman, the tailor’s, house. The said property is free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>from taxes, with the exception of five pounds interest, including
the commutation-capital, which I owe out of it to Herr Bernhard
Tillman, treasurer of the council at Berne, for money lent. Item, my
silver utensils, household furniture, colours, painter’s gold and silver,
implements for painting, and other things, nothing excepted, that he
shall appropriate the same as my appointed heir, have it in his possession,
do with it and live as with his own possession and property,
unmolested by my sisters and by any one. What I have here bequeathed
to him, will be found noted on a separate roll, so that my
cousin can better inquire after it.”<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c020'><b>[336]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f336'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r336'>336</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, English translation, p. 106. Original text in
Woltmann, ii. p. 33-5.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>He left what property he possessed in Augsburg to his three sisters,
Ursula Nepperschmid and Anna Elchinger in Augsburg, and Margreth
Herwart in Esslingen. The will is dated September 6, 1540, and the
testator died very shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class='c023'>On the 18th of November the Berne Town Council wrote to both
Basel and Augsburg notifying his heirs of his decease, and on the
10th January in the following year the property was handed over to
Holbein’s stepson, as the authorised agent of his mother. The confirmation
of the testament, in the name of Hans Franz Nägely, burgomaster
of Berne, speaks of him as “the honourable and wise Franz
Schmid, citizen of Basel,” and says that he brought “a procuracy and
a letter from Elsbeth, the wife of Master Hans Holbein, the painter,
citizen of Basel, and also a letter from the burgomaster and council
of the town of Basel.”</p>

<p class='c023'>This legacy would serve to some extent in place of the annuity of
40 gulden paid by the Council to Elsbeth Holbein, which would cease
when her husband failed to carry out his part of the agreement.
Woltmann suggests that she probably settled in Berne in consequence
of this bequest, in the house on the sunny side of the Brunnengasse,
although there is no documentary proof of this. On the other hand,
the inventory of her household goods and property, drawn up after
her death in 1549, and preserved in Basel, indicates that she never
permanently severed her connection with that city.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PHILIP HOLBEIN AND JACOB DAVID</div>
<p class='c023'>Holbein must have set out again for England shortly after the
drawing up of this agreement, and there is some reason to suppose
that he travelled back by way of Paris, taking his elder son, Philip,
with him, and apprenticing him in that city for six years to Jacob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>David, the goldsmith, who was a native, and still remained a citizen,
of Basel. This information is obtained from a letter addressed to
David from the Burgomaster Adelberg Meyer and the Council of
Basel, dated 19th November 1545,<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c020'><b>[337]</b></a> with reference to a dispute between
the apprentice and his master, the latter refusing to give him his discharge
on the completion of his six years’ service. This letter speaks
of Holbein as deceased, and refers to Philip as a “good, pious youth,”
still in his minority, and under the care of his step-brother, Franz
Schmid.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f337'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r337'>337</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Discovered, and first published, by Dr. His-Heusler.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>David is informed that “it has credibly reached our ears that thou
wilt give no discharge to Philipp Holbein (but that thou hast brought
him moreover in Paris before the Lord-Lieutenant), although he has
served thee honestly and honourably his six years, which were promised
by his father, the deceased Hans Holbein, our citizen, now when
he, at befitting opportunity, desires to depart from thee, and this not
alone on account of his honest and honourable service, as was thy duty
before God and in all honour. Thus thou addest one cause of complaint
to another, and aimest at oppressing the good, pious youth as far as
thou canst and in causing his ruin. This thine unfriendly conduct has
caused us not a little regret; we had in no wise foreseen it, but had
rather hoped that if any one sought to hinder another in his success and
welfare, thou would’st have taken up his cause and protected him....
Besides, this Philipp Holbein is in his minority, and is under the care
of Franz Schmid, his brother, our citizen, and without his help and
authority is qualified for no lawsuit; it is our pleasure, therefore,
and we herewith request thee as our citizen, that thou forthwith and
immediately breakest off the complaint brought by thee against Philipp
Holbein and allowest him, kindly and friendly to depart from thee, and
because he has served thee honestly and truly, that thou givest him a
good sealed letter of discharge, of which he may make use. In all this
we express our earnest will and command; we have also written to the
Lieutenant who is judge between you both, our citizens, not to continue
the proceedings, and to refer you both hither.” The letter concludes by
saying that if David feels he has a just claim against Philip, he is to
cite him before the municipal court of Basel, when full justice shall be
done. A letter to the same effect, and of the same date, was sent to
Philip, ordering him not to enter into any further law proceedings in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Paris, but to take his discharge and return to Basel, where his case
would be decided by the municipal authorities.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c020'><b>[338]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f338'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r338'>338</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woltmann, English translation, pp. 329-30.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>It seems clear from this letter to David that the dispute arose
shortly after the completion of Philip’s six years of apprenticeship,
in which case the boy must have been left in Paris in the autumn of
1539, and not of 1538. If that was so, then Holbein cannot have
personally apprenticed him on his return to England from Basel, and
Philip must have gone there a year later in charge of someone else.
It is possible, however, that Holbein took his son with him to England,
and kept him there for twelve months or so, sending or taking him
to Paris in 1539. It is usually supposed that the boy in the family
group of 1528 represents Philip, the elder son, born about 1522. In
the picture he appears to be five or six years old. He would thus be
about fifteen or sixteen in 1538—rather a late age upon which to
enter his apprenticeship—and twenty-two at the date of the letter,
which, however, speaks of him as still a minor.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c020'><b>[339]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f339'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r339'>339</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is possible that the boy in the picture is not the one
who was taken to Paris, but that the latter was a second son, born
during Holbein’s second residence in Basel (1528-32), whose age would
thus be in better accord with the evidence of the letter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Holbein was back again in London some time before Christmas,
1538, when he received the special reward of £10 for his journey into
Upper Burgundy. His first work of importance after his return was a
portrait of the infant Prince Edward, then some fourteen months
old. This was presented to the King on January 1, 1539, being entered
in the roll of New Year’s gifts as: “By Hanse Holbyne a table of the
pictour of the p<b>i</b>nce (Prince’s) grace.” In return he received from his
royal master a silver-gilt covered cup supplied by Cornelis Hayes, one
of the King’s goldsmiths. “To Hans Holbyne, paynter, a gilte cruse
w<b>t</b> a cover (Cornelis) weing x oz. quarter.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAITS OF PRINCE EDWARD</div>
<p class='c023'>Holbein died when Edward was just six years old, so that he cannot
have painted the various portraits of the Prince in which he is represented
at a somewhat later period of life and after he was King, though
at one time they were all attributed to him. There are only three
portraits of him, and a few drawings, which show him as a child of
tender years, of which the authorship can be given to Holbein. The
picture in the Provinzial Museum, Hanover, is generally regarded as
the original work which he painted as a New Year’s gift for the King.
An almost identical picture is in the possession of the Earl of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Yarborough, which some writers regard as an unquestionable work of
Holbein, while others consider it to be merely an excellent old copy.</p>

<p class='c023'>The Hanover picture<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c020'><b>[340]</b></a> is a life-size, half-length figure, facing the
spectator. The child is dressed in a red velvet coat trimmed with
gold, and sleeves of gold brocade. A red hat, with gold tags and a
large ostrich feather, tied under the chin, surmounts the closely-fitting
cap, from beneath which his fair hair falls over his forehead. His
right hand is held out with open palm, and in his left he grasps a gold
rattle. In front of him is a stone or panel on which eight lines of
Latin verse from the pen of Sir Richard Morysin are inscribed, exhorting
the Prince to imitate his wonderful father. “Little one, imitate your
father,” the lines run, “and be the heir of his virtue, the world contains
nothing greater—Heaven and Nature could scarcely give a son whose
glory should surpass that of such a father. You only equal the acts
of your parent, the wishes of men cannot go beyond this. Surpass
him, and you have surpassed all the kings the world ever worshipped,
and none will ever surpass you.”<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c020'><b>[341]</b></a> The head stands out well against
the sky-blue background. The round, chubby face, and small fat
hands, are most truthfully and delightfully rendered, while the colour
scheme is very harmonious. It is, indeed, in all ways, a most sympathetic
and delightful study of childhood.</p>

<p class='c023'>The Duke of Northumberland’s version, at Syon House,<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c020'><b>[346]</b></a> is larger,
and the Prince is shown at full-length. It resembles the two others
in most particulars, and appears to be based on the same original
drawing, though the sitter looks somewhat younger. He is wearing
a jacket of patterned cloth of gold, and over it a crimson frock or coat
embroidered with golden stripes. His head is covered with a white-edged,
striped skull-cap, beneath which a fringe of fair hair falls on
the forehead; over this is worn a red hat with a dark feather in it.
Thick-soled, broad-toed shoes complete his costume. He is standing
on a green velvet cloth edged with gold, which is thrown over an
ornamental stone tablet containing, as in the other versions, Morysin’s
Latin verses. The background is a dark green curtain. It is painted
on panel, 4 ft. 3 in. high by 2 ft. 5 in. wide.</p>

<p class='c023'>This picture has suffered considerably from rubbing and cleaning.
The preliminary chalk drawing can be plainly seen through the thin
painting. The position of the hands—which are beautifully painted—is
somewhat altered, and the child is without his rattle. In one corner
of the tablet is inscribed “Edwardus Princeps,” and in the other
“Filius Henrici 8,” now almost obliterated. Mr. Wornum<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c020'><b>[347]</b></a> thought
it probable that this was the New Year’s gift picture, as the child
appears to be a little younger than in the Hanover and Yarborough
versions, and with a still brighter expression of face.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DRAWINGS OF PRINCE EDWARD</div>
<p class='c023'>All three pictures seem to have been based upon the same drawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>in the Windsor Collection, in which the Prince is shown full-face, as a
young child, with a close skull-cap, and a black cap with a feather
above it, and a single frill round his neck.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c020'><b>[348]</b></a> This drawing has been
badly rubbed. There is a second drawing in the same collection,
also full-face, with hair cut closely across the forehead, and a plain black
hat (<a href='#pl-23'>Pl. 23</a>).<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c020'><b>[349]</b></a> This, too, has suffered considerable damage. The strong
brush-work of the outlines stands out with undue emphasis, owing to
the destruction of the more delicate modelling of the crayons. In this
drawing the Prince appears to be at least a couple of years older than
in the other drawing, or in the Hanover picture and its variants. He
looks quite four or five years old. Mr. Wornum thought it might
represent Henry Brandon, afterwards Duke of Suffolk, from its likeness
to the boy in Holbein’s beautiful miniature, the proportions of the
face not quite agreeing with those of the infant Prince;<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c020'><b>[350]</b></a> but it is
undoubtedly a portrait of the latter.</p>

<p class='c023'>There is a third drawing of Edward VI at Windsor, in which he
seems to be quite six, if not older. It is one of the least pleasing of
the series, and if by Holbein, must be almost the last drawing he made,
as the Prince was but six when the painter died. He is shown in
profile to the left, with hat and feather, and almost yellow hair.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c020'><b>[351]</b></a>
Several portraits exist which are based on this drawing, though they
are not by Holbein, among the best of them being the versions in the
National Portrait Gallery,<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c020'><b>[352]</b></a> the Victoria and Albert Museum,<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c020'><b>[353]</b></a> and the
collection of Lord Sackville. The last-named was at the Burlington
Fine Arts Club in 1909 (No. 60). In this the Prince has golden hair,
a black cap with a white plume, and a purple gown lined with white fur
over a pale pink doublet. His right hand, raised, holds a rose, and
his gloves are in his left. The background is a greenish blue.</p>

<p class='c023'>There is a very interesting drawing in coloured crayons by Holbein
in the Basel Gallery,<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c020'><b>[354]</b></a> which is described as a portrait of Edward VI,
and bears considerable likeness to the various paintings and drawings
in England. The face, however, is decidedly longer and more oval
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>in shape than in the Windsor drawings; but much of the delicate
modelling of the flesh has vanished during the passage of time, so that
it is difficult to speak with absolute certainty as to the likeness. Most
probably the attribution is the correct one. The boy, who appears
to be about five years old, is dressed in a princely costume, and is
holding a meerkat in the bend of his right arm, and stroking its back
with his left hand. There is no portrait known which follows this
drawing.</p>

<p class='c023'>Upon one of the leaves of Holbein’s sketch-book, preserved in the
Basel Gallery, there is a delightful little circular drawing of Edward
when a small child,<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c020'><b>[355]</b></a> evidently of about the same date as the Hanover
portrait. His costume is much the same as in the pictures described,
and he is seated on a cushion on the grass, fondling a small dog with
his left hand. The background on either side of him is filled in with
branches of oak with acorns. It may have been the first study for
a miniature, or possibly a design for a medallion or hat-badge
to be carried out in gold-and-enamel by one of Holbein’s goldsmith
friends. In spite of its small size the likeness is evident.</p>

<p class='c023'>The scope of this book does not permit any attempt to give a detailed
list of the numerous portraits of the young prince painted after the
death of Holbein, in which he is represented at an age varying from
about ten to sixteen, some of them being works of very considerable
merit. In the days when it was believed that Holbein lived until 1554,
all these portraits were attributed to him, whereas now some other
authorship must be sought. It is known that Guillim Stretes, the Dutch
painter, was responsible for at least two of these portraits of the
young King. According to Strype,<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c020'><b>[356]</b></a> in 1551 Stretes was paid by the
Privy Council “fifty marks for recompence of three great tables, made
by the said Guillim, whereof two were the pictures of his Highness
sent to Sir Thomas Hoby and Sir John Mason (ambassadors abroad); the
third a picture of the late Earl of Surrey, attainted, and by the
council’s commandant fetched from the said Guillim’s house.” In 1553
“Gillam Strettes, Dutchman,” was the King’s painter, in receipt of the
high salary of £62, 10<i>s.</i> a year, and he continued in favour
during the reign of Queen Mary.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>LATER PORTRAITS OF EDWARD VI</div>
<p class='c023'>The excellent little bust portrait of Edward, formerly in the
possession of the Cokayne family at Rushton Hall, Northamptonshire,
which was lent by Lord Aldenham to the Burlington Fine Arts Club
in 1909 (No. 63), has been attributed to this painter. It is dated
1550. Mr. Roger E. Fry,<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c020'><b>[357]</b></a> on account of the delicate and personal
scheme of blonde and cool colouring which it displays, considers this
portrait to be by the same hand as the portraits of Henry VIII and
Jane Seymour, lent to the same exhibition (Nos. 21 and 46) by
Lord Sackville, which have been mentioned in an earlier chapter.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c020'><b>[358]</b></a>
Others exist of the same type to which Stretes’ name has been provisionally
given. The Duke of Portland has a fine small full-length,
undated,<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c020'><b>[359]</b></a> probably from the same hand as Lord Aldenham’s panel;
another whole-length belongs to Mr. Vernon J. Watney, while a third
is at Southam Delabere, near Cheltenham. A very interesting portrait
of a different type is at Petworth, an elaborately-painted likeness
of the young King at full-length, seated on his throne, with a canopy
over his head, which is dated 1547, when he was in his tenth year.
This is attributed by Mr. Wornum to Stretes.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c020'><b>[360]</b></a> There is another in
Christ’s Hospital which closely resembles it, and in the same building
there is a second portrait of the Prince at the age of nine. There is
also a fine example in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle,<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c020'><b>[361]</b></a> in which
the head is of the same type as that in Lord Aldenham’s picture. It is
apparently by the same hand as that of the Princess Elizabeth, also
at Windsor, and whether by Stretes or not, seems to be of Franco-Flemish
origin. The large picture at Bridewell Hospital, representing
Edward VI transferring Bridewell Palace to the City of London, was
regarded in Walpole’s day as an excellent example of Holbein’s brush,
and both he and Vertue, who engraved it in 1750, asserted that one
of the figures in the background represented Holbein himself.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c020'><b>[362]</b></a> The
occurrence which the picture commemorates, however, took place in
1553, ten years after Holbein’s death. This picture, too, has been
tentatively given to Stretes, but it is a work of no great mastery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>though of undoubted historical interest. Descriptions of other portraits
of Edward VI will be found in a paper contributed by Mr.
J. Gough Nichols, F.S.A., to <i>Archæologia</i>.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c020'><b>[363]</b></a> No less than sixteen,
of varying degrees of merit, were lent to the Tudor Exhibition in 1890.
In the inventory of King Henry VIII’s pictures made shortly after
his death, dated September 8, 1547, three of the earlier portraits of
the young Prince of Wales were included. Two of these were full-lengths:
“The Kynge’s Majestie, the whole stature, in a gowne like
crymsen satten furred with lusernes,” which was protected by a curtain
of white sarcenet; and “The Kynge’s Majesty, the whole stature,
stayned upon clothe” (<i>i.e.</i> canvas), with a curtain of green sarcenet.
The first named was not included in the earlier list of King Henry’s
pictures drawn up in 1542, but the latter is in that inventory, and so
must have been painted before 1542, and thus represented Edward as a
little child. The third portrait is merely described as “The Kynge’s
Majestie.” This may have been the curious “perspective” portrait
of the young Prince, now in the National Portrait Gallery (No. 1300),<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c020'><b>[364]</b></a>
a head within a circle surrounded by a well-painted landscape, done
in 1546, which has been attributed to Stretes. According to Walpole,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c020'><b>[365]</b></a>
who considered it to be the work of Marc Willems, “Gulielmus
pinxit” was written on the frame. It formed part of the Royal
collections from the time it was painted, but was sold by the Commonwealth
in 1650 for £2. It was seen in Whitehall and described by the
German traveller, Paul Hentzner, in 1598. Two miniatures of Edward
were lent to the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition (Case C, 13
and 19) by the Duke of Buccleuch, but these are not by Holbein.</p>

WITH the exception of works executed for his royal
master, such as the “Duchess of Milan” and the
lost French portraits, the likeness of the infant Prince
Edward, and that of Anne of Cleves, there is nothing
by Holbein which can be ascribed with absolute
certainty to the years 1538 and 1539.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c020'><b>[366]</b></a> It is possible
that the portraits of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and his
son, Henry, Earl of Surrey, were produced in the latter year, but
no dated likeness by him is known of any member of the court
circle, or, indeed, of any Englishman or German, painted during
these two years. It is true that more than one of his undated
works may be of this period, but there is no actual proof, beyond that
of style, in favour of such a contention. This may be accounted for
to some extent by his frequent absences from England on the King’s
business, which would leave him less time than usual for private
practice, while there is also the possibility that at least some of the
works he produced during these two years have been lost.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f366'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r366'>366</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The portrait of Henry VIII in the National Gallery, Rome,
now attributed to Holbein, was painted, according to the King’s age
inscribed on the background, in 1539 or 1540. See above, p. 103.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>By the beginning of 1539, when alarms of war were in the air, and
the alliance between Francis and the Emperor was growing closer
every week, Henry had abandoned all idea of a marriage in France
or with the Duchess of Milan, and was turning his thoughts towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Protestant Germany. The project of this fresh matrimonial venture
was not entirely a new one; it was under consideration during the
previous summer in the midst of the more active negotiations elsewhere.
There is a curious passage in one of Eustace Chapuys’ letters
to the Emperor, dated London, 17th June 1538, in which he infers that
Henry had grown less anxious for the Milan match because the Germans
were making him offers. “Indeed it is a fact,” he says, “that about
that time the King sent to Germany a painter (<i>ung paintre</i>) and one
gentleman of his chamber for the express purpose of pourtraying the
personages ‘au naturel’; for, although Cromwell at first denied this,
or at least dissembled, he afterwards owned to me (Chapuys) that
the report was true, that both from France and Germany several
marriages had been proposed.” These marriages, he adds, according
to report, were to be between the son of the Duke of Cleves and the
Princess Mary, and Henry and one of the Duke’s kinswomen.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c020'><b>[367]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>This is the only reference in the State Papers to the despatch of
one of the King’s painters to Germany in the earlier part of 1538, but
it is interesting as containing a possible reference to Holbein and to
some journey of his of which we have no further knowledge. It is
much more likely, however, that Chapuys was misinformed, and that
no such expedition actually took place, though it may have been
suggested but afterwards abandoned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>SEARCH FOR A BRIDE IN GERMANY</div>
<p class='c023'>About the middle of January 1539, Christopher Mont, or Mount, a
German in Henry’s service, was sent abroad with letters of credence
to the Duke of Saxony and the Landgrave. The ostensible purpose
of his mission was to promote the attempted agreement between the
English and German divines which had been the subject of numerous
conferences in the previous year; but the real object was to find out
to what extent Henry might rely upon the German Protestant princes
in any trouble which might arise between England and the Pope or
Emperor. At the same time, Mont, who was accompanied by Thomas
Paynell, took with him private instructions from Cromwell, which
included a secret message to Francis Burgartus,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c020'><b>[368]</b></a> the Duke of Saxony’s
vice-chancellor, with respect to a marriage between the young Duke of
Cleves and the Princess Mary, which he and Cromwell had discussed
in London in the previous year. If, the instructions ran, Burgartus
desire “the picture of her face,” Mont is to remind him that she is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>King’s daughter, and that it was not the custom to send the picture
of persons of such degree abroad. Burgartus, too, had seen her,
and could testify of her proportion, countenance, and beauty. But
there was a matter of still greater importance about which Mont was
to sound the vice-chancellor, whose master, the Duke of Saxony, had
married the eldest daughter of the Duke of Cleves, and was one of the
most interested parties in any alliance proposed between England
and Germany. Mont was to inquire diligently of the beauty and
qualities of the elder of the two unmarried daughters of the Duke of
Cleves, her shape, stature, and complexion, and, if he heard she was such
“as might be likened unto his Majesty,” he was to throw out suggestions
as to a marriage between her and the King. The proposal, however,
must come from the side of Cleves, as the overtures made to his Grace
in France and Flanders had not been finally refused. Mont, in short,
was not to speak as if demanding her, “but rather to give them a
prick to offer her;” but first of all, “it is expedient that they should

<p class='c023'>Shortly afterwards other diplomatists were sent abroad for the
same purpose. Dr. Barnes went over to Frankfurt to attend the diet
of the Evangelic League, while Dr. Edward Carne and Dr. Nicholas
Wootton, together with Richard Byrd, Bird, or Beard, one of the
gentlemen of the King’s Chamber, were despatched to Düren, to the
court of the young Duke of Cleves, whose father had recently died.
Their instructions were very similar to those given to Mont. They
were to offer an offensive and defensive league and an English bride
to the Duke, but were merely to throw out hints with regard to Anne.
Here again they were to demand a picture of the lady before the
match could be considered, for Henry was always most anxious to
see what his proposed bride was like before committing himself too
far.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c020'><b>[370]</b></a> If she were ill-favoured he would have none of her, however
useful for political reasons such an alliance might prove to be. A
portrait was always asked for, but was by no means always considered
sufficient. The King feared that such pictures might flatter the
subject, and so it became his habit, in order to avoid such possibilities,
to send over one of his own painters to procure an independent likeness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Holbein, in particular, he knew to be capable of bringing back
a true portrait, more valuable in all ways than the efforts of some
unknown foreign painter, or the written opinions of his ambassadors,
whose taste might not always agree with his own.</p>

<p class='c023'>Mont, after an interview with the Duke of Saxony, wrote to
Cromwell to say that he seemed favourable to the proposed marriage,
and that he promised to send a portrait as soon as possible, but said
that “his painter Lucas was sick at home.” “Everyone,” he added,
“praises the lady’s beauty, both of face and body. One said she
excelled the Duchess (of Milan) as the golden sun did the silver moon.”<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c020'><b>[371]</b></a>
The Lucas referred to in this letter was Lucas Cranach the elder, and
if it had not been for his illness Holbein might not have been sent
over, for Cranach, no doubt, would have painted a portrait which
would have satisfied the King. Towards the end of April, Cromwell
wrote to Beard and Wootton, again urging them to get a portrait of
the lady, which the former was to bring to London as quickly as
possible.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c020'><b>[372]</b></a> In their reply, dated May 3—the letter, unfortunately,
is badly mutilated—they describe a recent interview with Dr. Henry
Olisleger, the vice-chancellor of Cleves, the young Duke being away at
the Diet. “He said also he would cause the portraits of both the
Duke’s younger sisters to be delivered to us in fourteen days. They
were made, he said, half a year before. We said there was no occasion
to declare the King’s goodwill to the Duke, which was manifest....
And as for the ij pictures, we wer verye w[ell] contentyd to receyve
theym, and specyallye the imaige of my l[ady Anne] ... that yf
eny of bothe shulde lyke his Grace ... yet wolde we gladdelye

the ij ladyes, we shulde [not be] able to advertise his Majestye whether
theyr imaiges were [l]yke to theyr persones, and so shulde his Majestye
be never the nerre by the syht of the pictures.” Dr. Olisleger, however,
assured them that the portraits were faithful likenesses, but the ambassadors
were not satisfied. “We sayde, we hadde not seene theym,
for to see but a parte of theyr faces, and that under such a monstruouse
habyte and apparell, was no syght, neither of theyr faces nor of theyr
persones. Why, quod he, wolde yow see theym nakydde?” What
they said in answer to this last remark is lost through the mutilation
of the letter, but they evidently did not approve of the court costume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of Cleves. They concluded by saying: “A Moneday, God willing, we
wylle departe to Duisseldorpe, and, excepte the Duke have enye
bysynesse with us, we wyll thence to Coleyn, where we ar apoyntyd
to receyve the said ij pictures, the which we wille send ynto England

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN AND BEARD GO TO DÜREN</div>
<p class='c023'>In spite of these constant demands for portraits, the ambassadors
do not appear to have received them at the time promised. Early in
July Dr. William Petre, one of the Clerks of Chancery, was sent to
Cleves with further messages and instructions to Dr. Wootton. The
new ambassador and the old were to make a further demand to see
the ladies, and if Beard had not already started with the portraits,
they were to send them “if they may be possible gotten,” with their
opinion of them as likenesses.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c020'><b>[374]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Beard was back in London for a short time in July, but whether
he came empty-handed or not there is no record to show. It is
possible that he brought with him the two portraits promised by
Olisleger, which were to be handed to him at Cologne. There is a
portrait of Anne in England, described below, which may be one of
the two in question, but in any case it cannot have satisfied Henry,
for Beard was sent back almost immediately to Düren, taking Holbein
with him, in order that he might paint the two sisters. They were
allowed £40 for travelling expenses, while Holbein received a further sum
of £13, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for his own personal outlay in
connection with his craft.</p>

<p class='c023'>The following is the entry in the Treasurer’s accounts:</p>

<p class='c025'>“July, A<b>o</b> xxxi—Item, to Mr. Richard Bearde, one of the gromes of the
Kingis privi-chambre, and Hans Holbyn, paynter, by like lettre sent
into the parties of High Almayne upon certain his gracis affaires, for

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r375'>375</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>C.L.P.</i>, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 781 (f. 85).</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>According to Dr. Woltmann, the extra fee of £13, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> paid to
Holbein for “the preparation of such things as he is appointed to
carry with him,” was, “without doubt a portrait of the King, perhaps
a miniature in a costly frame, which he had to paint and to present
to the Princess as a gift from his monarch.”<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c020'><b>[376]</b></a> This explanation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>however, is not at all likely to be the correct one. As already pointed
out, Henry never sent portraits of himself to the lady he was preparing
to honour with his hand until he had first of all seen what she herself
was like. He was too cautious a lover to commit himself so far. In
all these transactions he was the one who was to be sought, and the
first offer must come from the lady’s side. The simplest explanation
is that the money was for the provision of the necessary painting
materials, and the cost of their carriage. The sum was, no doubt, a
large one if for such a purpose alone, but Holbein was then high in the
King’s favour, and well paid for all that he did, while his absence from
England on the royal business put an end for the time to his general
practice, and this might have been considered in fixing the amount of
his allowance.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The travellers reached the castle of Düren, where the ladies were
living, early in August, and Holbein at once set to work. He had
finished portraits of both Anne and her sister Amelia before the 11th
of the month, as we learn from a letter of that date from Dr. Wootton
to Henry VIII. In the course of it he says: “Your Grace’s servant
Hanze Albein hathe taken th’effigies of my ladye Anne and the ladye
Amelye and hath expressyd theyr imaiges verye lyvelye.”<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c020'><b>[377]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>It seems probable that in this instance Holbein did more than
make mere studies in crayons such as he had done in the case of the
Duchess of Milan and the French ladies; and the fact that the portrait
of Anne of Cleves, now in the Louvre, is on parchment fastened down
on a wood panel affords some proof of this. The portrait would be
painted on the parchment directly from the sitter, and afterwards
mounted and the finishing touches given to it. Owing to the haste
required, and the safer conveyance of the portrait, the latter
process was probably not carried out until the artist was back in
London.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>GOSSIP ABOUT THE KING’S MARRIAGE</div>
<p class='c023'>No time appears to have been wasted. Henry not only demanded
but obtained speed from his servants on their numerous journeys.
Travelling post, the journey to and from Düren, which was usually
made via Antwerp, took about eleven days. Holbein was in England
again before the end of August, as we learn from Marillac, the new
French ambassador, who, on September 1, writing from Grafton,
where he had followed the King fifty miles from London, informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Francis I that he “has learnt that an excellent painter whom this
King sent to Germany to bring the portrait of the sister of the Duke
of Cleves, recently arrived in Court, and, immediately afterwards, a
courier, bringing, among other news which is still kept secret, news
that the said Duke’s ambassadors have started to come hither to treat
and conclude the marriage of this King and the said lady.”<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c020'><b>[378]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f378'>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The proposed marriage afforded opportunity for much speculation
on the part of the King’s subjects, as more than one of his earlier
matrimonial projects had done. An excellent idea of the kind of
gossip which prevailed can be gathered from the evidence taken in
the case of a certain George Constantyne, who talked so much that he
got himself charged with treason. It occurs in the report of a conversation
between Constantyne and the Dean of Westbury during a
journey they made together to South Wales, and in the course of it
Holbein’s visit to Cleves is mentioned. “The Dean asked also if
Constantyne had any news of the King’s marriage. Replied, he could
not tell; he was sorry to see the King so long without a queen, when he
might yet have many fair children: his own father was ninety-two
years old, and yet, last summer, rode thirty-two miles one day before
two o’clock, and said he was not weary; the duchess of Milan and that
of Cleif were both spoken of, as the Dean knew. Asked, ‘How call
ye the little doctor that is gone to Cleif?’ The Dean said, it was Dr.
Woten, and that he that was with him of the Privy Chamber, whom
Woten sent home lately, was Berde; adding that this Berde was sent
thither again with the King’s painter, and that there was good hope
of the marriage, for the duke of Cleif favoured God’s word and was a
mighty prince now, having possession of Gelderland against the
Emperor’s will.... Said also that the matter of the duchess of Milan
was really broken off, for she would have the King accept the bishop
of Rome’s dispensation and give pledges. ‘Why pledges?’ asked the
Dean. ‘Marry,’ said Constantyne, ‘she sayeth that the King’s
Majesty was in so little space rid of the Queens, that she dare not trust
his Council, though she durst trust his Majesty; for her Council
suspecteth that her great aunt was poisoned, that the second was
innocently put to death, and the third lost for lack of keeping her in
childbed.’ Added, that he was not sure whether this was her answer
or that of Cleif, but that he heard a muttering of it before Whitsuntide.”<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c020'><b>[379]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>It will be seen from this gossip that the legend respecting
the Duchess of Milan’s refusal to accept Henry because she had fear
for the safety of her head was commonly believed at the time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The written descriptions of Anne which Henry received from his
representatives and agents were all favourable, but not enthusiastic.
Wootton in the letter referring to Holbein, already quoted, says of
her: “She has been brought up with the lady Duchess her mother
(as the lady Sybille also was till she was married and the lady Amelye
has been and is) and in manner never from her elbow, the lady Duchess
being a wise lady and one that very straitly looketh to her children.
All report her to be of very lowly and gentle conditions, by the which
she hath so much won her mother’s favour that she is very loth to
suffer her to depart from her. ‘She occupieth her time most with
the needle, wherewithall she.... She canne reede and wryte her
... Frenche, Latyn, or other langaige she [hathe no] ne, nor yet she
canne not synge nor playe [upon] enye instrument, for they take it
heere in Germanye for a rebuke and an occasion of lightenesse that
great ladyes shold be lernyd or have enye knowledge of musike.’
Her wit is good and she will no doubt learn English soon when she puts
her mind to it. ‘I could never hear that she is inclined to the good
cheer of this country and marvel it were if she should, seeing that her
brother, to whom yet it were somewhat more tolerable, doth so well
abstain from it.’”<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c020'><b>[380]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Sir Michael Mercator, the German factor of musical instruments,
knighted by Henry, wrote to Cromwell later in the year, giving praise
to God “for this alliance with the most illustrious, beautiful, and noble
lady Anna de Clefves, who has a great gift from God, both of sense
and wit. It would be difficult to describe her good manners and grace,
and how Gueldres, Cleves, and all the country of the Duke, rejoice
at the alliance.”<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c020'><b>[381]</b></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE “FLANDERS MARE” LEGEND</div>
<p class='c023'>Around Holbein’s portrait of Anne there has been woven a legend
which upon examination is found to have no foundation in fact. The
story is to be traced back to Bishop Burnet, who, in his <i>History of the
Reformation</i>, says:<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c020'><b>[382]</b></a> “Hans Holbin having taken her picture, sent it
over to the king. But in that he bestowed the common compliment
of his art somewhat too liberally on a lady that was in a fair way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>be queen the king liked the picture better than the original, when he
had the occasion afterwards to compare them.” Instead of the
promised beauty, continues the bishop, they brought him over a
“Flanders mare.”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f382'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r382'>382</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Vol. i. pt. i. p. 543.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Walpole, following Burnet, elaborates this: “Holbein was next
despatched by Cromwell to draw the lady Anne of Cleve, and by
practising the common flattery of his profession, was the immediate
cause of the destruction of that great subject, and of the disgrace
that fell on the princess herself. He drew so favourable a likeness,
that Henry was content to wed her; but when he found her so inferior
to the miniature, the storm which really should have been directed
at the painter, burst on the minister; and Cromwell lost his head,
because Anne was <i>a Flanders mare</i>, not a Venus, as Holbein had
represented her.”<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c020'><b>[383]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f383'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r383'>383</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Walpole, <i>Anecdotes</i>, ed. Wornum, i. p. 72.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>There is no truth at all in this story. The leading characteristic of
Holbein’s portraiture is its complete truth; he was not in the habit of
flattering his sitters, and the portrait of Anne affords one of the most
striking testimonies of this. He certainly did not paint her as a
Venus, nor was Cromwell’s fall owing to the picture. He was, indeed,
made Earl of Essex after the lady’s marriage to the King. Letters
in the State Papers show very clearly that Henry complained only of
the spoken and written words of his ambassadors, and made no
mention of portraits. Russell, the Lord High Admiral, in his deposition
in connection with the divorce, quoted Henry as saying to
him: “How like you this woman? do you think her so fair and of
such beauty as report hath been made unto me of her? I pray you
tell me the truth.” Whereupon the said Lord Admiral answered,
that he took her not for fair, but to be of a brown complexion. And
the king’s highness said, “Alas! whom should men trust? I promise
you,” said he, “I see no such thing in her as hath been showed me of
her, and am ashamed that men hath praised her as they have done,
and I like her not.” Stow, in quoting this, adds without authority
the words: “either by pictures or report,” after “I see no such thing
in her as hath been showed me of her.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Stow, apparently drawing upon his own imagination, makes
exaggerated references to the part portraits played in the negotiations
for the marriage. “Some went over by the king, some by the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Cromwell, and some went voluntary, to view the Lady Anne of Cleave,
and to negotiate her marriage with the king. All which, either by
letters, speech, or both, made very large and liberal reports in praise
of her singular feature, matchless beauty, and princely perfections,
and for proof thereof presented the king with sundry of her pictures,
which the bringers ever affirmed to have been truly made, without
flattery.”<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c020'><b>[384]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f384'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r384'>384</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stow, <i>Annales</i>, ed. Howes, p. 576.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Henry, however, in his own declaration, never refers to a portrait.
He entered into the marriage, he said, “because I heard so much both
of her excellent beauty and virtuous conditions.” In addition, he
told Sir Anthony Browne, “I see nothing in this woman as men report
of her, and I mervail that wise men would make such report as they
have done.” He also told Cromwell, in reply to his question as to
how he liked the lady, “Nothing so well as she was spoken of; if I
had known as much before as I know now, she should never have come
into the realm. But what remedy?”</p>

<p class='c023'>After all, however, the praises of her sent home by Henry’s ambassadors
were not very hearty ones. In Hutton’s letter from
Brussels, already quoted,<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c020'><b>[385]</b></a> written shortly after Jane Seymour’s death,
in answer to a request that he would search for a possible bride for
the King at the Court of the Regent, he reported, among other princesses,
that “the Dewke of Clevis hathe a daughter, but I here no
great preas neyther of hir personage nor beawtie.” Wootton’s account,
given above, is a remarkably cautious one, and lays most stress on
Anne’s domestic virtues. He had also complained that he had found it
impossible to judge of the personal appearance of the two ladies on
account of the ugly head-dresses they wore.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f385'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r385'>385</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See p. <a href='#Page_116'>116</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Had the fault been Holbein’s, he would, no doubt, have fallen
under the King’s displeasure. At the least his appointment would
have been taken from him, even if he had not been forced to leave
England; but the contrary was the case. In September, after his
return from Cleves, he received, for a second time, a whole year’s
salary in advance. This was, of course, before the King had seen
the original of the portrait; but, strangely enough, if the accounts
are to be believed, in addition to this year’s advance, Holbein continued
to receive his salary every quarter day for the next year, so
that he was paid twice over.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c020'><b>[386]</b></a> It is thus very evident that the painter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>suffered no disgrace or lack of employment or patronage, so that the
legend must be abandoned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF ANNE OF CLEVES</div>
<p class='c023'>The fine portrait of Anne of Cleves now in the Louvre (<a href='#pl-24'>Pl. 24</a>) is in
all probability the picture which Holbein painted in Düren.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c020'><b>[387]</b></a> It is
almost three-quarter length, less than life-size. She is shown standing,
facing the spectator, her hands folded in front of her, and dressed in a
very elaborate costume. Her sumptuous gown of red velvet with
wide hanging sleeves has heavy bands of gold embroidered with pearls.
The bodice is cut square, and is edged with a band of ornament decorated
with jewels, and a similar one round the neck with a pendant
jewelled cross. She also wears two gold chains, and several rings on
her fingers. The open front of the dress is filled in with fine white
linen with bands of embroidery. Her hair is covered with an almost
transparent head-dress worked with an elaborate pattern and the
motto “<span class='sc'>A bon fine</span>,” over which is a cap wrought all over with gold,
pearls, and other jewels. Her lace cuffs are also gold-embroidered.
The background is blue-green, without inscription. Her brown eyes
look straight at the spectator. More than one writer, influenced no
doubt by these stories of her lack of beauty, has described this portrait
as the likeness of a heavy, expressionless, ill-favoured woman; but
this is far from being the case. Without any pretensions to extraordinary
good looks, the face is a pleasant one, and by no means as
plain as it has been described; indeed, in many ways it compares
favourably with that of Queen Jane Seymour. That it is a truthful
representation is certain, for Holbein never failed in this respect.
Nothing is known of the history of the picture, or how it came to find
a home in France, except that it was at one time in the Earl of Arundel’s
possession,<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c020'><b>[388]</b></a> and afterwards in the collection of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class='c023'>Walpole speaks of the portrait done by Holbein in Düren as a
miniature. He was inclined to believe that the beautiful miniature
of Anne, now in the Salting Collection at South Kensington, which in
his days belonged to the Barretts of Lee Priory, was the very miniature
painted by Holbein on this occasion. “This very picture,” he says,
“as is supposed, was in the possession of Mr. Barrett, of Kent....
The print among the illustrious heads is taken from it: and so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>justifies the king, that he certainly was not nice, if from that picture
he concluded her handsome enough. It has so little beauty, that I
should doubt of its being the very portrait in question—it rather seems
to have been drawn after Holbein saw a little with the king’s eyes.
I have seen that picture in the cabinet of the present Mr. Barrett, of
Lee, and think it the most exquisitely perfect of all Holbein’s works as
well as in the highest preservation. The print gives a very inadequate
idea of it, and none of her Flemish fairness. It is preserved in the
ivory box in which it came over, and which represents a rose, so
delicately carved as to be worthy of the jewel it contains.”<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c020'><b>[389]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>It is not known in what way this miniature,<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c020'><b>[390]</b></a> together with the
companion portrait of Henry VIII,<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c020'><b>[391]</b></a> in a similar ivory box, in the
late Mr. Pierpont Morgan’s collection, came into the possession of the
Barrett family. They were offered for sale by auction in 1757, but
bought in; and subsequently sold by Mr. T. B. Barrett in 1826 to a
dealer named Tuck, who resold them for fifty guineas to Francis
Douce, by whom they were bequeathed, in 1834, to Sir Samuel Rush
Meyrick, of Goodrich Court. At a later date the miniature of Anne
of Cleves was bequeathed by General Meyrick to Miss Davies, from
whom it was acquired by the late Mr. George Salting. This miniature
follows very closely the portrait in the Louvre, though there are slight
differences in the details and colour of the dress. The background is
blue, without inscription. It is in water-colours, and is 1¾ in. in
diameter. It was from this miniature, which is regarded as an
undoubted work by Holbein, that Houbraken engraved, in 1739, the
portrait of Anne for his “Illustrious Heads.”</p>

<p class='c023'>When the Louvre picture was in the Arundel Collection it was

taken from a picture or drawing in the Arundel Collection, of a lady
in profile to the right, wearing a flat black cap, which, it has been
suggested, also represents Anne of Cleves (Parthey, 1545). The
likeness is not very apparent, nor does the original appear to have
been by Holbein, as Hollar states. It is reproduced by Dr. Ganz,

<div class='sidenote'>OTHER PORTRAITS OF ANNE OF CLEVES</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>There are several other portraits in existence which are said, with
little authority, to represent Anne of Cleves; among them a drawing
in the Windsor Collection,<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c020'><b>[393]</b></a> which appears at one time to have become
separated from the others. It came into the possession of Dr. Meade,
and at his sale in 1755 was bought by Mr. Chetwynd. After the
latter’s death it was restored by his executors to the royal collection.
It bears little or no resemblance to the Louvre portrait, and is almost
certainly a likeness of some English lady. She is shown full-face, with
a close-fitting cap covering the ears, and a hat over it. The drawing
has been damaged by having been cut out round the outline. The
face is a refined one. There are notes in German as to the material
and colours of the dress, and the pattern of the Spanish work on the
collar is drawn in detail on the margin. It has no inscription. In
the National Portrait Exhibition at South Kensington in 1865, a small
head of “Anne of Cleves” was exhibited by the Earl of Derby. It was
in oil on panel, oval, about 3 in. by 2½ in., and signed “H. H.” It
had been injured, and was then in a somewhat dirty condition; the
face had considerable likeness to the Louvre picture.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c020'><b>[394]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>There is, however, one other portrait in addition to the Louvre
panel which is a contemporary likeness of Anne of Cleves, though not
by Holbein. This is the small picture in St. John’s College, Oxford,
a fine work by some unknown painter of the Flemish School. It is a
half-length, standing three-quarters to the left, behind a parapet upon
which lie an orange and a pair of jewelled gloves. The head-dress is of
cloth of gold and white gauze, the latter worked with the motto, “<span class='sc'>A
bon fine</span>,” as in the Louvre picture. She is wearing a low-cut dress of
striped gold and black, filled in with white with embroidered bands,
gold and jewelled necklaces, and a pendant cross, and several rings on
her fingers. Her left hand is placed against her waistbelt, and in her
right she holds three carnations. The background is dark, with a
small canopy or curtain over her head. It is on panel with arched
top, 19¾ in. by 14¼ in. The costume is of the same style and period
as the Louvre portrait, though it differs in numerous small details,
more particularly in the colours of the materials, the shape of the
sleeves, and the jewelled bands of the head-dress. The general tone
of colour is golden, and there is excellent painting in all the details of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the elaborate costume. It was included in the Oxford Exhibition of
Historical Portraits in 1904 (No. 30), and was one of the most interesting
pictures in the collection.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c020'><b>[395]</b></a> As a likeness it bears a strong resemblance
to Holbein’s portrait, and if not of Anne may well be of her
sister. The suggestion may be hazarded that it is one of the two
portraits, painted six months before Holbein and Beard were in Düren,
which Olisleger had promised to procure for Henry VIII’s ambassadors,
portraits which Beard, apparently, took with him to London early in
July 1539.</p>

vol. v., May 1904, p. 214. A very similar picture was lent by Dr.
Wickham Flower to the New Gallery Winter Exhibition, 1899-1900, No.
44, as a work of the Early Flemish School. It was described in the
catalogue as: “Half-length, turned towards left, habited in a rich
Flemish costume of gold tissue covered with jewellery; head-dress
ornamented with pearls, and inscribed with the motto ‘A bon fine’; in
her right hand she holds a red carnation; flat green background.
Painted on vellum and strained on fine canvas, 15 in. × 14 in. This
portrait is supposed to have been executed by a Flemish painter a year
or two previous to Anne’s marriage in 1540.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>There is no need even to touch upon the concluding stages of this
miserable story, with which Holbein had nothing to do. Henry married
Anne at Greenwich on January 6, 1540, and finally divorced her on
July 12 in the same year. She settled at Richmond in the enjoyment
of the rank of a princess and a pension of £3000 a year, and
survived the King by ten years, dying in 1557.</p>

Though there is no actual evidence in support of the
statement of the older writers that Holbein, after he
entered the royal service, had the use of a permanent
studio in Whitehall Palace, granted to him by the
King, there is every possibility that such was the
case. “One of the earliest of the famous non-royal
residents in Whitehall Palace,” says Dr. Edgar Sheppard, “was the
artist Holbein. He had been presented to Henry VIII by Sir
Thomas More, and the King assigned him a permanent suite of
apartments in Whitehall, and commissioned him to paint the
interior of the new Palace, for which work he received two hundred
florins per annum.”<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c020'><b>[396]</b></a> While the great wall-painting in the Privy
Chamber was in progress, it would be necessary for him to have
a room for his own use within the building, for the storage of
the materials required for the work, and it is not impossible that
he was permitted to retain the room as his own, perhaps one of
those over the so-called “Holbein’s Gate,” for the short remainder
of his life, more particularly as his practice was almost entirely confined
to the court, so that a studio in Whitehall would best suit the
convenience both of the painter and his sitters.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c020'><b>[397]</b></a> That he had a “permanent
suite of apartments” there, as Dr. Sheppard states, is much
less probable. This would indicate residence, whereas it is known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>that during his last years he occupied a house in the east of
London.</p>

<p class='c023'>It is doubtful, too, whether Holbein carried out any important
decorative work in the Palace beyond the famous wall-painting already
described.<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c020'><b>[398]</b></a> According to a curious entry in Pepys’ <i>Diary</i>, under
the date August 28, 1668, which is not easy to understand, the room
known as the Matted Gallery had a painted ceiling of Holbein’s handiwork.
The passage runs as follows: “With much difficulty, by
candle-light, walked over the matted gallery, as it is now with the
mats and boards all taken up, so that we walked over the rafters.
But strange to see how hard matter the plaister of Paris is, that is
there taken up, as hard as stone! And pity to see Holben’s work in
the ceiling blotted on, and only whited over!” The exact sense of
the concluding words is not very clear, but Pepys appears to mean
that the ceiling had been formerly painted by Holbein, and that,
having become damaged in course of time, it had recently been given
a coat of whitewash. The ceiling was probably decorated with
coloured plaster-work in relief, and though Holbein may have supplied
the design, and may even have been responsible for the painting, it
is much more likely that the plaster-work itself was done by some
Italian, such as Nicolas Beilin of Modena, who had carried out similar
undertakings at Fontainebleau.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f398'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r398'>398</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1576 Johann Fischart, quoted by Ganz, <i>Holbein</i>, p. xxxviii.,
in a description of the Palace, speaks of several of the galleries as
decorated on both sides with fine emblematic histories, and actions
and stories in the style of Michelangelo and Holbein. Henry Peacham,
in his <i>Graphicè</i> (1606), and again in <i>The Compleat
Gentleman</i> (1634), speaks of works by Holbein in Whitehall. He
says: “He painted the Chappell at White-Hall, and S. <i>James</i>,
<i>Joseph of Arimathea</i>, <i>Lazarus</i> rising from the dead, &amp;c.,
were his.” (See <i>The Compleat Gentleman</i>, ed. G. S. Gordon, 1906,
p. 128. Also Walpole, <i>Anecdotes</i>, ed. Wornum, i. p. 82.) There
is a drawing in the British Museum representing Henry VIII seated at
table under a lofty canopy, in a large chamber, with a number of
standing courtiers in attendance, which appears to be a
sixteenth-century copy of a preliminary study by Holbein for a wall-decoration,
possibly for one of the rooms in Whitehall. It is
inscribed “Holbein Inven<b>t</b>.” Reproduced by Ganz, <i>Holbein</i>, p.
183.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>“DANCE OF DEATH” AT WHITEHALL</div>
<p class='c023'>The legend that Holbein also painted a “Dance of Death,” composed
of life-size figures, upon the walls of one of the rooms in Whitehall,
is probably pure fiction, or, at least, there is much less to be said
in its favour than for Pepys’ attribution of the ceiling in the Matted
Gallery to the painter. The writer who first gave currency to the
story was Francis Douce, in his “Dance of Death,” published in 1833.
According to his statement, “very soon after the calamitous fire at
Whitehall in 1697,<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c020'><b>[399]</b></a> which consumed nearly the whole of that palace,
a person, calling himself T. Nieuhoff Piccard, probably belonging to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the household of William III, and a man who appears to have been
an amateur artist,”<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c020'><b>[400]</b></a> made etchings after nineteen of the cuts in the
Lyon “Dance of Death.” Impressions of these etchings, accompanied
with manuscript dedications, are said to have been presented by this
Piccard to his friends and patrons, and among others to a Mynheer
Heymans, and to the “high, noble, and well-born Lord William
Denting, Lord of Rhoon, Pendreght,” &amp;c. In these addresses Piccard
speaks of a “wall-painting” of the “Dance” by Holbein which
he himself had seen in Whitehall. In the dedication to Heymans
he says:</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f399'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r399'>399</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Should be 1698.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r400'>400</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Holbein’s Dance of Death</i>, ed. 1858, p. 124.</p>
</div>

<p class='c025'>“Sir,—The costly palace of Whitehall, erected by Cardinal Wolsey,
and the residence of King Henry VIII, contains, among other performances
of art, a <i>Dance of Death</i>, painted by Holbein in its galleries,
which, through an unfortunate conflagration, has been reduced to
ashes.”</p>

<p class='c027'>In the dedication to “Lord William Benting” Piccard is more
precise:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Sir,—In the course of my constant love and pursuit of works
of art, it has been my good fortune to meet with that scarce little
work of Hans Holbein neatly engraved on wood, and which he himself
had painted as large as life in fresco on the walls of Whitehall.”</p>

<hr class='c031' />

<p class='c023'>As far as can be ascertained, there is not the slightest truth in this
legend. Nothing is known as to the identity of Heymans, but Lord
William Benting was evidently William Bentinck (1704-1774), of
Rhoon and Pendrecht in Holland, and Terrington St. Clements,
Norfolk, third son of Hans William Bentinck, first Earl of Portland,
and a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. Douce, who gave
undeserved authority to this story, made no attempt to trace the
history of the manuscript “addresses” which accompanied the
etchings, and though he saw them, does not say to whom they then
belonged, or even in what language they were written. They may be
safely set down as forgeries, as far as any wall-paintings of the “Dance
of Death” by Holbein are concerned. Piccard, whoever he may
have been, is the sole authority for the existence of these mythical
works, which are not mentioned by Van Mander or Sandrart, or by
any of the foreign travellers who visited this country in their
descriptions of Whitehall, though the wall-painting of Henry VIII
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>with his wife and parents in the same palace is more than once
spoken of in such records in terms of high praise. Both Pepys and
Evelyn are equally silent on the subject, though the latter mentions
the “Dance of Death” woodcuts, and ascribes them to Holbein by
name. “We have seen,” he says, “some few things cut in wood
by the incomparable Hans Holbein the Dane, but they are rare and
exceedingly difficult to come by; as his <i>Licentiousnesse of the Friers
and Nuns</i>; <i>Erasmus</i>; <i>Moriae Encomium</i>; <i>the Trial and Crucifixion of
Christ</i>; <i>The Daunce Macchabree</i>; the <i>Mortis Imago</i>, which he painted
in great in the Church at Basil, and afterwards graved with no lesse
art.”<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c020'><b>[401]</b></a> What he says is by no means free from mistakes, but as, in
speaking of a visit paid to Whitehall in 1656, he describes the condition
of the large wall-painting of the two kings Henry VII and Henry VIII,
and their consorts, it is not probable that he would have failed to
mention any other important wall-paintings in the palace had they
existed. Douce thought he had discovered a corroboration of Piccard’s
story in an entry in Van der Doort’s catalogue of Charles I’s collection,
which runs: “A little piece, where Death with a green garland about
his head, stretching both his arms to apprehend a Pilate in the habit
of one of the spiritual Prince-Electors of Germany. Copied by Isaac
Oliver from Holbein”; but this, no doubt, was painted from the
woodcut of the Elector in the Lyon “Dance of Death,” and not from
a large wall-painting.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>As already stated, though Holbein may have had a workroom
within the precincts of Whitehall, his permanent home in London was
elsewhere. The public records show that in 1541 he was living in the
parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, in Aldgate Ward. How long he
had been there is not known, but possibly for the greater part of his
second sojourn in England. This information is contained in a subsidy
roll for the City of London, dated 24th October, 33 Hen. VIII (1541).
Among the “straungers” taxed were:</p>

    <td class='c038'>iij. <i>li.</i>”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Why Holbein was obliged to pay twice the amount charged to Buttessey
on an equal assessment of £30 a year is explained by the fact that in
these subsidies it was usual to tax “lands, fees, and annuities,” at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>double the rate of goods. “In the royal accounts,” says Sir
Augustus W. Franks, “the payments to Holbein are sometimes
noticed as wages, sometimes as an annuity; while other payments
of a similar kind, although fees or annuities, are included under the
general term “wages,” and evidently looked upon as synonymous
terms for the salaries paid by the King to various members of his
household. In any case, the salary of Holbein, the painter, rendered
him liable to be rated, as a foreigner, at the high amount above-mentioned.”<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c020'><b>[402]</b></a>
There can be no doubt that this Holbein of the subsidy
roll was the artist. The amount of his fee, £30, corresponds with the
salary he received from the royal purse, while Holbein’s will gives his
place of residence as the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S RESIDENCE IN LONDON</div>
<p class='c023'>According to a story told by Walpole, Holbein once resided in a
house on London Bridge. He says: “The father of Lord Treasurer
Oxford passing over London Bridge, was caught in a shower, and
stepping into a goldsmith’s shop for shelter, he found there a picture
of Holbein (who had lived in that house) and his family. He offered
the goldsmith 100<i>l.</i> for it, who consented to let him have it, but desired
first to show it to some persons. Immediately after happened the
fire of London, and the picture was destroyed.”<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c020'><b>[403]</b></a> This story is apparently
a mere legend, and there is no evidence to support it; nor
is it very probable that an important painting by Holbein would have
remained in the same small house for more than one hundred and
twenty years. Dallaway, in his notes to Walpole, includes in a
supplementary list of works by Holbein in England a small picture
of Holbein, his wife, four boys, and a girl, at Mereworth Castle, Kent,
which he suggests may be either a repetition or the original picture
of the London Bridge story; but in the first place, Holbein never
had a family of four sons, and, secondly, the picture bears no traces
of Holbein’s manner. He quotes Gilpin’s description of it: “As a
whole, it has no effect; but the heads are excellent. They are not
painted in the common flat style of Holbein, but with a round, firm,
glowing pencil, and yet exact imitation of nature is preserved—the
boys are very innocent, beautiful characters.” If some such “family”
picture existed in London at that time, it is much more likely to have
been a copy or a replica of the genuine family group in the Basel
Gallery.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>The favour with which Holbein was now regarded at court is shown
by the frequency with which he received a year’s or half a year’s
salary in advance, a mark of royal condescension which was most
unusual. Thus under “September A<b>o</b> xxxi” (1539) is the following
entry: “Item paide by the Kingis highnesse commaundement
certefied by my lorde privyseales lettres to Hans Holbenne, paynter,
in the advauncement of his hole yeres wagis beforehande, aftre the

quarterly entries in the accounts having reference to Holbein, from
Michaelmas 1539 to Midsummer 1540, that he continued to receive his
salary of £7, 10<i>s.</i> each quarter as usual.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c020'><b>[406]</b></a> If these entries are to be
depended upon, he clearly received his money twice over, either by
accident, owing to carelessness in the keeping of the King’s accounts,
or of set purpose as a further reward for his services.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f406'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r406'>406</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first of these was due to him, and not covered by the year’s advance.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>HIS WORK ABOUT THE COURT</div>
<p class='c023'>In September 1540 he received an advance of half a year:
“September, A<b>o</b> xxxii—Item paide to Hans Holbyn, the Kingis
paynter, in advauncement of his wagis for one half yere beforehande,
the same half yere accompted and reconned fromme Michaelmas last
paste, the somme of xv <i>li.</i>” This time, however, he did not receive
his salary twice over, for in the two following entries, at Michaelmas
and Christmas, 1540, the accounts merely state: “Item, for Hans
Holbyn, paynter, wages, nihil, quia prius per warrantum.” In the
following March 1541 he again obtained a half-year’s advance:
“March, A<b>o</b> xxxii: Item paied to Hans Holben, the Kingis painter, in
advauncement of his half yeres wages before hande, after the rate of
xxx <i>li.</i> by yere, which half yere is accompted to beginne primo Aprilis
A<b>o</b> xxxij. domini Regis nunc, and shall ende ultimo Septembris then
next ensuynge, the somme of xv <i>li.</i>” The two remaining entries
of which we have record, at Lady Day and Midsummer following,
are as follows: “Item for Hans Holben, paynter, wages, nil, quia
praemanibus”; and “Item for Hans Holbyn, paynter, nihil, quia
prius.” The volume of accounts closes with the payments for this
quarter, and no details of the royal expenditure during the next two
years and a half exist, so that there is no record of the salary Holbein
received for the remaining years of his life. In a later volume of
Tuke’s accounts, as treasurer of the household, extending from
October, 35 Hen. VIII (1543) to November, 36 Hen. VIII (1544), the
first quarterly payments are for Christmas 1543, and Holbein’s name
does not occur in them, as he had then been dead for about two
months. It is rather strange, however, that it does not appear among
the Christmas payments with “Nihil quia mortuus” after it, as this
was the usual procedure in case of death. This omission, however,
may have been due to the fact that he had once again received his
salary beforehand.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>The remaining years of Holbein’s life must have been busy ones,
judging from the number of preliminary studies for portraits of the
men and women of Henry’s court which exist in the Windsor Collection
and in many of the great European museums. These drawings
are all undated, and cover the whole period of his English career, but
there are so many of them that his time must have been always fully
occupied. It is strange, therefore, that so few of his finished portraits
can be ascribed with any certainty to the year 1540. Although it was
by no means his invariable custom to put the date on his paintings,
yet this was his more usual practice, and there is no known picture
by him which is inscribed 1540, though there are a few dated 1541
and 1542. Several portraits of the Howard family can be given with
some certainty to the earlier year, but beyond this nothing has been
so far discovered. It may be suggested, as some explanation of this,
that Holbein paid another visit to Basel during the last quarter of
1540, as the two years’ leave of absence granted him by the Town
Council came to an end in the middle of October. The Council, who
had been paying his wife the promised yearly pension of forty gulden,
expected him to make Basel his permanent residence on the completion
of this further extension of leave. The terms of their agreement
with him were fairly generous, and it is not to be supposed that
the painter would risk losing his rights of citizenship and the stoppage
of the pension to his wife through a total disregard of the Council’s
wish. It seems possible, therefore, that he went over to Switzerland
in order to make personal application for a further and longer leave of
absence in England than the agreement of 1538 permitted. Unlike
many of the foreign artists and artificers then resident in this country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>he never became a naturalised British subject, and this, no doubt,
was due to the fact that he was determined to end his days as a citizen
of Basel, and regarded his residence here as merely a temporary one,
and England as a profitable field which, as time passed, would become
worked out. He could not, of course, foresee that he was to be
suddenly cut down when a comparatively young man and still in the
full maturity of his powers. At Michaelmas in the year in question
he received half a year’s salary in advance, so that it was impossible
for him to leave England permanently for some time to come.</p>

<p class='c023'>In the summer of 1540 Holbein lost another of his English patrons.
Henry formally divorced Anne of Cleves on the 12th of July, and on
the 28th of the same month Thomas Cromwell, then Earl of Essex,
who had been a good friend to the painter, was beheaded for high
treason, after a period of eight years during which his influence with
both King and Parliament had been paramount. During the same
month Henry privately married Catherine, daughter of Lord Edmund
Howard, a cousin of Anne Boleyn, and niece of Thomas, third Duke of
Norfolk. By this marriage the Howards, and through them the
Catholic party, regained that ascendancy in the councils of the King
which had received a severe check at the fall of Anne Boleyn; and at
least three members of this family were painted by Holbein. The new
Queen was publicly acknowledged on August 8 at Hampton Court
Palace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MINIATURES OF CATHERINE HOWARD</div>
<p class='c023'>Although it was to be supposed that Henry would employ Holbein
to paint the portrait of his new queen, until quite recently the only
known likeness of her from his brush was the miniature portrait in the
royal collection at Windsor Castle, and the replica of it belonging to
the Duke of Buccleuch. In 1909, however, the discovery was made
by Mr. Lionel Cust of a genuine and very beautiful portrait of this
Queen. In the Windsor miniature (<a href='#pl-31'>Pl. 31</a> (4)),<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c020'><b>[407]</b></a> which shows her in
a similar position to the one in the newly-discovered picture, she is
represented nearly to the waist, turned to the left, her hands folded in
front of her, the left over the right. Her hair and eyes are brown, and
she wears a circular hood of the then fashionable French pattern, with a
fall of black velvet. Her square-cut bodice is of dark cloth of gold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>with sleeves of grey-green silk embroidered with gold, and white ruffles
with black embroidery. Round her neck, over the white cambric
filling of the dress, falls an elaborate necklace of pearls, rubies, and
sapphires. The background, which is bright blue, has no inscription.
It is painted on the back of a playing card, the eight of diamonds, and
is 2⅓ inches in diameter. The hands, and the lower part of the arms,
are badly painted, and appear to be a later addition.</p>

<p class='c023'>Nothing is known of its history, or as to the date of its acquisition,
but it did not belong to the Crown in Tudor or Stuart days. Dr. Ganz
describes it as badly over-painted, and possibly only a copy. Doubts
have been thrown from time to time on its right to be called a portrait
of Catherine Howard. Mr. Ernest Law considers the attribution to
be “very problematical indeed,” and states that it “does not at all
accord with the Holbein drawing inscribed as ‘Queen Katherine
Howard.’”<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c020'><b>[408]</b></a> In this he follows earlier writers. Nichols says that
though the position and head-dress of the drawing agree with the
miniature, “the features do not appear to correspond.”<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c020'><b>[409]</b></a> It is
difficult, however, to agree with them in this, for a careful comparison
of the two makes it quite evident that they represent the same lady.
The version belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch is almost identical
with the Windsor miniature, but is a better work and slightly smaller,
being only two inches in diameter. It was last publicly exhibited at
the Burlington Fine Arts Club, in 1909.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c020'><b>[410]</b></a> It was formerly in the
collection of the Earl of Arundel, and when there was etched by
Hollar in 1646. It was afterwards owned by Jonathan Richardson
the younger (1694-1771), and subsequently by Horace Walpole.
Walpole describes it as: “Catherine Howard, a miniature, damaged,
it was Richardson’s, who bought it out of the Arundelian collection.
It is engraved among the Illustrious Heads [of Houbraken]; and by
Hollar, who called it Mary, Queen of France, wife of Charles Brandon,
Duke of Suffolk.”<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c020'><b>[411]</b></a> In this he is wrong, for no name is attached to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>it in Hollar’s etching, and it was first identified as Catherine Howard
by Mr. Cust. In his <i>Description of Strawberry Hill</i>, however,
Walpole calls it merely “a lady painted by Holbein,” and says that
it is “probably Mary Tudor, Queen of France, sister of Henry VIII,
but among the Illustrious Heads called Catherine Howard.” According
to Granger, it was Vertue who first named it Mary, Queen of France.
The Duke of Buccleuch also possesses a small oil painting on panel,
5⅜ in. × 4½ in., which was likewise at the Burlington Fine Arts
Club (Case C, 24). It is inscribed, by a hand later than that of the
painter of the portrait, “Catherine Howard Henry VIII.” According
to Scharf, this is “apparently a French work, and, indeed,
thoroughly so in personal characteristics.”<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c020'><b>[412]</b></a> It is in the style of
Clouet, and the compilers of the Burlington Fine Arts Club catalogue
suggest that it may represent Anne de Pisseleu, Duchesse
d’Estampes.</p>

<p class='c023'>The Windsor drawing<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c020'><b>[413]</b></a> bears no inscription, and the sitter is turned
to the right, as in Hollar’s engraving, instead of to the left, but otherwise
it shows the same type of features, smooth auburn hair, and
French cap or hood, as in the miniature. The dress, however, in
Holbein’s usual fashion, is merely indicated with a few lines, showing
a plain bodice cut square, filled in with white cambric, with a diamond-shaped
opening revealing neck and bosom. It agrees in the same
way with the newly-discovered portrait, of which, though reversed,
it is evidently one of the preliminary studies. The identity with
Catherine Howard is further proved, as Mr. Lionel Cust points out,
by the family resemblance, plainly visible, in certain of the features,
such as the over-accentuated lower jaw, to the portraits of her uncle,
the Duke of Norfolk, and of his son, the ill-fated Earl of Surrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF CATHERINE HOWARD</div>
<p class='c023'>In 1898 the Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery acquired a
portrait of Catherine Howard<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c020'><b>[414]</b></a> at the sale of the Cholmondeley pictures
at Condover Hall, Shropshire, which closely follows the Windsor
drawing, although in the reverse position. The excellence of the
painting of the hands, and of the details of the dress and jewels, led
at first to the supposition that it might be a genuine work by Holbein
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>which had undergone some damage and restoration, but closer examination
proved that it was merely a careful contemporary school copy,
or repetition of some lost original. It is inscribed “<span class='sc'>Etatis svæ 21</span>,”
which corresponds with the known facts of Catherine Howard’s life.
In the summer of 1909 the original picture of which it is a copy was
submitted to Mr. Cust, who recognised it at once as not only a portrait
of Catherine Howard, but as most possibly a genuine work of the
great master, which proved to be the case on the removal of much
dirty varnish and some repaints.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c020'><b>[415]</b></a> It came from a private collection
in the west of England, where it had formed part of a series of historical
portraits which had been in the possession of the same family for
several generations, and had been regarded at one time as a portrait
of Eleanor Brandon, Countess of Cumberland, and at another as
Princess Mary Tudor. It is now in Canada, in the collection of
Mr. James H. Dunn.</p>

<p class='c023'>Henry’s fifth Queen is shown seated, at a little more than half
length, turned to the left. The hands are in the same position as
in the miniature, though the fingers are more closely interlaced. Her
hair is auburn, parted in the middle, and the eyes are blue-grey. She
wears, too, a costume of a similar fashion, though of different materials.
The circular French hood, with its heavy band of gold ornament and
black fall, appears to be the same, but the dress is of black satin, with
a square black velvet yoke across the bosom, open at the neck and
turned back to show the white lining. A band or piping of gold
ornament elaborately pierced, with pairs of gold tags at intervals,
runs along the outer seam of the sleeves from shoulder to wrist, and
the white ruffles are embroidered all over with a floral design in black.
The ornaments she wears are of exceptional interest, as they afford
actual evidence that Holbein not only painted portraits of royal ladies,
but also designed their jewellery. Round her neck is a small necklace,
set with pearls and diamonds, less heavy and elaborate than the one
represented in the miniatures, and of greater beauty and delicacy of
design, to which a large pendant jewel is attached. At her breast
is a brooch from which hangs a circular jewel or medallion of chased
gold work, with a large oblong diamond in the centre, on which is
represented the story of Lot’s wife and the flight from Sodom. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>jewel was designed for Catherine by Holbein. It corresponds exactly,
as Mr. Cust points out, with a most characteristic study, a small
roundel placed within an octagon, among the wonderful series of
Holbein’s original drawings for jewellery in the Print Room of the
British Museum,<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c020'><b>[416]</b></a> and thus gives particular interest to a portrait
which in all ways forms a very important addition to the master’s
work, both on account of the brilliance of its execution and of its
value as an historical document. Suspended from a chain round her
waist hangs a still larger circular jewel, only the upper part of which
is seen. That portion of the subject which is visible represents two
angels with hands raised in adoration on either side of a crowned and
bearded figure, most possibly the Almighty. The background of the
portrait is a plain one, of Holbein’s favourite blue, across which is
inscribed, as in the National Portrait Gallery copy, “<span class='sc'>Etatis svæ 21</span>,”
on either side of the head. It is on an oak panel 29 inches high by
20 inches wide. It must have been painted between August 1540,
the date of her marriage, and November 1541, when she was deprived
of her dignity as Queen, and forbidden to wear jewels; most probably
in the latter year, according to Mr. Cust, which would correspond with
her accepted age at the time of her marriage. Its importance and
its genuineness have been accepted by such leading authorities as
Dr. Bode, Dr. Friedländer, Dr. Paul Ganz, and Sir Sidney Colvin.</p>

<p class='c023'>Catherine Howard’s reign as Queen of England was a short one.
There is no need to describe her tragic fate in detail. Before the
close of the year 1541 it was discovered that not only had she had two
lovers, one of them her cousin Francis Dereham, before her marriage,
but that she had also been unfaithful to the King almost from the
beginning of her married life, her paramour being one of her gentlemen,
Thomas Culpeper. The Queen and her accomplice, Lady
Rochford, were confined in Syon House, pending a parliamentary
inquiry. Dereham and Culpeper were tried at Guildhall in December,
pleaded guilty, and were hanged at Tyburn twelve days afterwards;
and in February 1542, Catherine and Lady Rochford were condemned
to death, and were beheaded on the 13th of the month, on the same
spot on which the Queen’s cousin, Anne Boleyn, had suffered the same
penalty for the same crime.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>This fresh tragedy in his life greatly aged the King, as can be
seen in the portraits of him painted about this period, usually attributed
to Lucas Hornebolt. A month after the execution, Marillac
wrote to Francis I, on March 17, 1542, that Henry was “already very
stout and daily growing heavier, much resembling his maternal grandfather,
King Edward, being about his age, in loving rest and fleeing
trouble. He seems very old and grey since the mishap (<i>malheur</i>) of
this last queen, and will not yet hear of taking another, although he
is ordinarily in company of ladies, and his ministers beg and urge him
to marry again.”<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c020'><b>[417]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF THOMAS HOWARD</div>
<p class='c023'>The portrait of Thomas Howard, third Duke of Norfolk, uncle by
marriage to Henry VIII, was painted at about the same time as that
of Catherine Howard. The inscriptions on the fine original version by
Holbein in Windsor Castle (<a href='#pl-25'>Pl. 25</a>),<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c020'><b>[418]</b></a> and the excellent contemporary
copy in Arundel Castle, both state that it was taken in his sixty-sixth
year, and as he is said to have been born in 1473, this gives the date of
the picture as 1539 or early in 1540. He is shown standing, at half-length,
slightly turned to the left. He is wearing a doublet of dusky
red silk, edged with brown fur, and a white collar embroidered with
black silk. His outer robe of dark velvet has a deep collar and border
of ermine, and on his head is a plain, flat black hat, without a badge,
over a black skull-cap which covers the ears. In his left hand he holds
the long white wand of his office of Lord High Treasurer, and in his right
the shorter gold baton, tipped with black, which he carried as hereditary
Earl Marshal of England. Across the shoulders hangs the magnificent
and richly-jewelled collar of the Order of the Garter with the pendant
George, which is painted with all Holbein’s wonderful mastery in the
clear rendering of minute ornament. The face, clean-shaven, and of a
brown complexion, displays remarkable subtlety in the delineation of
a proud and cruel nature. The cold, unflinching eyes, the thin,
compressed lips with their faint, ironic smile, and the bony hands
clasping the staves, reveal the sitter’s true character as it has come
down to us in the pages of history, pride of race, cruelty almost remorseless
in its pursuit of power, and inflexibility of purpose both in
personal aggrandisement and in the service of his royal master.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>The background is green, and across the top of the panel runs the

now almost illegible, through the passage of time and over-painting,
but can be deciphered by the aid of the exactly similar inscription
on the Arundel picture. This, as already stated, gives the date of the
portrait as about 1540. The inscription, however, is not contemporary,
but was probably added some hundred years later, in the reign
of Charles I, when the picture was in the collection of the Earl of
Arundel. It was finely etched by Vorsterman when in the Earl’s
possession, in 1630, though without the inscription, but beneath
the plate is engraved: “Hans Holbein pinxit. Visitur in Ædibus
Arondelianis Londini.” This does not necessarily prove that the
inscription on the panel did not exist at that date, as Vorsterman
may have omitted it as disfiguring. That it was certainly there
fifteen years later is proved by a coloured drawing on vellum by
Philip Fruytiers, the Antwerp painter, dated 1645, a copy of a study
by Van Dyck representing a large group of Thomas Howard, Earl
of Arundel, his wife, and family. On the wall in the background
Van Dyck had inserted, and Fruytiers has copied, on the one side,
this very portrait of the Duke of Norfolk by Holbein, in which the
inscription across the top of it in gold letters can be plainly seen, and
on the other side the portrait of his son, the Earl of Surrey, also evidently
a work by Holbein, though the original painting is now lost,
which is inscribed: “<span class='sc'>Henry Howard Erle of Suhry anno ætatis
svæ 25.</span>” This water-colour drawing, which is signed “An. Vandyke
inv. Ph. Fruytiers fecit 1645,” is in the collection of the Duke of
Sutherland, and there is a small copy of it in oils on copper at Norfolk
House, which also shows the inscription. It was engraved by Vertue
in 1743. The original sketch or composition by Van Dyck has
been lost.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF THOMAS HOWARD</div>
<p class='c023'>It is supposed that the Windsor version is the one which was in the
Arundel Collection, but its subsequent history is uncertain. That
collection was divided in 1686, and the share which fell to the Duke
of Norfolk may possibly have contained this portrait of his
ancestor.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c020'><b>[419]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>The Duke’s pictures were sold in 1692, and nothing further is to be
heard of this portrait until it is mentioned by Walpole as being then
(1762) in Leicester House, at that time the dower-house of the Dowager
Princess of Wales, widow of Frederick, Prince of Wales.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c020'><b>[420]</b></a> “There
can be no doubt,” says Mr. Ernest Law, “that the picture passed,
on the death of the Princess in 1772, into the possession of the Crown
with the rest of the collection which had been formed by Prince
Frederick.”<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c020'><b>[421]</b></a> It is not known from whom that Prince acquired it,
but many of his pictures were purchased for him on the Continent by
his agent, Bagnols, and it is not unlikely that Woltmann’s surmise
is correct, and that it is to be identified with the portrait of the Duke
which appeared in the catalogue of an anonymous sale of pictures at
Amsterdam on April 23, 1732, as “Een zeer konstig uitmuntent stuk
door Hans Holbeen, zynde de Hartog van Nortfolk nooit zoo goet
gezien,” which must have been a fine work, as it fetched the relatively
high price of 1120 florins.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c020'><b>[422]</b></a> It is quite possible, therefore,
that the portrait was one of those sold by Lord Stafford in Amsterdam
in 1654, immediately after the death of the Countess of Arundel, and
that it was never in the possession of the Duke of Norfolk, but remained
in that town until 1732.</p>

portrait of the Earl of Surrey, which is given to Holbein. It is
entered as “Ritratto de Tomaso Howard, Ducha de Nordfolk.”</p>

<p class='c023'>The copy at Arundel Castle, about which still less is known, is so
good that it is only when it is placed side by side with the Windsor
version, as it was in the Tudor Exhibition in 1890, that the latter is
seen to be by far the finer work of the two. The Arundel picture is
slightly the smaller, and was last exhibited at the Burlington Fine
Arts Club in 1909 (No. 49). There is a second version of this portrait
in the Norfolk collection, at Norfolk House, in which various alterations
have been made in the position and the dress, and a more
elaborate background has been added. It is a work of comparatively
little merit, and appears to have been painted during the seventeenth
century by some inferior artist.</p>

<p class='c023'>At the time he sat to Holbein the Duke was at the height of his
power. He had been the bitter enemy of both Wolsey and Cromwell,
and had assisted to bring about the downfall of both, and had arrested
the latter with his own hands. After Cromwell’s execution he became
the most powerful of Henry’s subjects, and reached his highest summit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>of greatness. His influence over the King, however, waned after the
fall of his niece, Catherine Howard, when he was supplanted by his
enemies, the Earl of Hertford and the Seymours. In 1546 he was
attainted, together with his son, the Earl of Surrey, for high treason,
and only escaped the latter’s fate by the death of the King on the
day the warrant for his execution was made out. He remained in
the Tower throughout the reign of Edward VI, but was released on
the accession of Queen Mary in 1553, and his titles and estates were
restored to him, but he only lived to enjoy them for a year.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAITS OF HENRY HOWARD</div>
<p class='c023'>That Holbein painted his son, Henry, Earl of Surrey, is proved
by the small portrait on the wall in Fruytiers’ version of Van Dyck’s
picture of the Arundel family. The inscription on this miniature
copy gives his age as twenty-five; and as he was born about 1517,
Holbein must have painted him about 1541. He is represented with
reddish hair and beard, and brown eyes, the head slightly turned to
the right, and wears a black cap with a feather, and a black mantle
from the folds of which the right hand appears. There is a small
drawing in the Windsor Collection wrongly inscribed “Tho. Howard
E. of Surrey,”<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c020'><b>[423]</b></a> which bears some likeness to the Earl in the Fruytiers
drawing, and is supposed to represent Henry Howard. It is badly
rubbed, and has suffered from retouching and certain coarse alterations,
and has the slightly-wavering touch which marks the so-called
“Melanchthon” in the same collection. It is apparently the original
study for the portrait which was engraved by Hollar when it was in
the Arundel Collection.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c020'><b>[424]</b></a> There are two other heads at Windsor
also named Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, but the attribution cannot
be correct, as Surrey’s son, Thomas, was a small boy of only six or
seven at the time of Holbein’s death. Whether the drawings represent
the poet himself is also doubtful. One of them, inscribed “Thomas
Earl of Surry” (<a href='#pl-26'>Pl. 26</a>),<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c020'><b>[425]</b></a> in which he is shown full-face, clean-shaven,
with hair cut straight across the forehead and partly covering the ears,
and wearing a black cap with scalloped edges and an ostrich feather,
is one of the finest drawings in the whole collection, conspicuous for
the delicacy of the modelling and the freedom and expressiveness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>of the draughtsmanship. The face is one of considerable charm,
which is not to be seen in the third drawing,<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c020'><b>[426]</b></a> inscribed “Tho. Earle
of Surry,” perhaps a little later in date, in which the head is turned
slightly to the left, and the hair entirely covered with the black skull-cap
he wears beneath the feathered bonnet. The dress is only slightly
indicated, and is rubbed, and a circular medallion suspended from a
broad ribbon hangs on his breast. A portrait of his wife is also to be
found among the Windsor heads,<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c020'><b>[427]</b></a> full-face, wearing the angular
English head-dress with black fall, and a round jewelled ornament
hanging from a chain round her neck, and a second medallion on her
breast. The dress which, like the ornaments, is badly rubbed, was
of rose-coloured velvet, according to a note in Holbein’s handwriting.
The portrait for which this drawing was the study, like that of her
husband, cannot now be traced. The two full-length portraits of
Henry Howard, dated 1546, at Arundel Castle and at Knole respectively,
are usually ascribed to the Netherlandish painter Guillim or
Gillam Stretes, on account of Strype’s statement, already quoted,<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c020'><b>[428]</b></a>
that in 1551 the Privy Council ordered a picture “of the late Earl of
Surrey, attainted,” to be fetched away from “the said Guillim’s
house.” The Duke of Norfolk’s version of the portrait<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c020'><b>[429]</b></a> has a very
elaborate architectural setting, coarsely painted in stone colour, and
apparently of a somewhat later date than the rest of the picture,
while the one belonging to Lord Sackville at Knole shows the figure
only, and is looked upon by some authorities as the original. The
attribution of these two pictures to Stretes is extremely doubtful.
The Arundel portrait, in particular, suggests the hand of an Italian,
and the name of Nicolas Beilin of Modena may be tentatively suggested.
One of them was in the collection of Thomas Howard, Earl
of Arundel, where it was attributed to Holbein. It is described in
the inventory of 1655 as “il ritratto del Conte de Surry grande del
naturale.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Only three dated works of the year 1541 remain; the two fine
portraits of men in the Berlin and Vienna Galleries, and the miniature
of Charles Brandon, the younger son of the Duke of Suffolk. The Berlin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>panel,<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c020'><b>[430]</b></a> (No. 586 C), is inscribed at the top, in gold, on either side of
the cap, “<span class='fss'>ANNO 1541</span>,” and lower down, in smaller letters, level
with the sitter’s ears: “<span class='fss'>ETATIS : SVÆ : 37.</span>” The coat of arms,
enamelled in red and white, on the gold ring on his left hand, indicates
that in all probability this young man was a member of the
Dutch family of Vos van Steenwijk, though the writer has failed to
trace the name, or any indication of a sojourn in or visit to England
on the part of its bearer, in the Calendars of the English State Papers.
It is a half-length portrait, considerably less than life-size, head and
body turned to the right, but both eyes shown. The eyes are grey,
and the finely painted beard and moustache are a reddish brown.
In his clasped hands he holds a pair of brown gloves. He wears a
black silk under-dress and a surcoat of black or very dark brown, with
the collar turned over to show the lining of black watered silk, and
his flat cap of the same colour has a turned-down brim. He is gazing
to the spectator’s right with a far-away and slightly melancholy look
in his eyes, which are wonderfully painted, as is the beautiful and
expressive left hand. It comes from the Von Sybel, Elberfeld, Merlo
of Cologne, and Suermondt collections, having been purchased from the
last-named owner in 1874.</p>

<p class='c023'>The picture of an unknown man, aged twenty-eight, at Vienna<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c020'><b>[431]</b></a>
(No. 1479) (<a href='#pl-27'>Pl. 27</a>), is still finer in expression, and, indeed, is one of
the most brilliant portraits of Holbein’s later years. It is one of his
customary half-length figures, less than life-size, seated at a table, the
body turned to the right, and the face looking out at the spectator. His
doublet is of purple-brown silk, and over it he wears the usual black
cloak with a deep collar and lining of brown fur, and black cap with
a brim. The collar of his white shirt is beautifully embroidered with
black Spanish work and tied with black laces. His grey gloves are
held in his left hand, and his right rests on the olive-green cloth of
the table, the forefinger being thrust within the pages of a gilt-edged
book, near which is placed an inkstand with a red cord. On one of
his rings is an intaglio. The clean-shaven face, showing blue on chin
and upper lip, is of a ruddy brown complexion, and the hair, which
does not cover the ears, is almost concealed by the hat. The unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>sitter, who appears to be an Englishman, is comely in features, and
the eyes have a far-seeing, visionary expression, which Holbein has
rendered with extraordinary vividness and subtlety of drawing.
The upper part of the background consists of a blue-grey wall, with
wooden panelling, or the back of a long wooden seat, below, and the
panel is inscribed on either side of the head: “<span class='fss'>ANNO · DNI · 1541 ·
ETATIS · SVÆ · 28.</span>” It was in the collection of the Archduke Leopold
William in the seventeenth century. There is an old copy of this
picture in the Palermo Gallery (Woltmann, 223).</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>To the year 1542 belongs the small portrait of an unknown Englishman
in the Hague Gallery (No. 277) (<a href='#pl-28'>Pl. 28</a>),<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c020'><b>[432]</b></a> which, again, is brilliant
in execution, the details painted with the minutest care, but with
a touch both delicate and free from all hardness, and unusual richness
of colour. The head is full-face, the body turned slightly to the
left. His closely cropped hair is chestnut in colour, turning to red at
the ends of his moustache and short pointed beard. It is almost the
only portrait by Holbein in which the sitter is shown without a hat.
He wears a dress of black velvet and watered silk with a pattern,
slashed with red silk at the shoulder and wrist. On his left hand,
which is gloved, stands his falcon, a large bell on its claw. His right
hand, in which he holds the bird’s hood, is ungloved, with a gold ring
set with a stone on the little finger. The light falls from the right,
and the shadow on the left side of the face is more strongly marked
than in most of Holbein’s portraits. The modelling is fine, the face
full of strong character, and, as usual, the hands are most expressively
painted, the whole presentment being most vivid and life-like. The
background is a plain blue-grey, of much the same tone as that in
the portrait of 1541 at Vienna. Across the panel is inscribed, on
either side of the head, the date 1542, and lower down “<span class='fss'>ANNO · ETATIS ·
SVÆ · XXVIII</span>.” Little is known about the history of this picture,
except that it was at one time in the royal collections of England, and
that it was taken to Holland by William III, and was included in the
list of works of art reclaimed by Queen Anne after that King’s death.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c020'><b>[433]</b></a>
Like the portrait of Cheseman, however, it remained abroad. It is
inscribed on the back “The manner of Holbein,” and in old catalogues
was absurdly described as a portrait of Sir Thomas More.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>UNDATED PORTRAITS OF LAST YEARS</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>It is probable that during this year Holbein painted Sir William
Fitzwilliam, created Earl of Southampton in 1538, who died at Newcastle
in 1543. There is a fine drawing of the head in the Windsor
Collection,<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c020'><b>[434]</b></a> turned three-quarters to the right, wearing a black cap
with a medallion, and ear-flaps, or a coif, tied under the chin; slight
whiskers are indicated on the cheek-bones. It is a face of strong individuality,
with a big nose, finely and boldly drawn, the dress only roughly
indicated. There is a full-length portrait of the Earl, 6 ft. × 3 ft.
3 in., in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (No. ii. 164),<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c020'><b>[435]</b></a> which is
described in the catalogue as probably a copy of the original picture
by Holbein which, in 1793, was destroyed by fire at Cowdray House,
the estate purchased by the Earl in 1528. He is represented standing
to the right, and wearing a black cap tied under the chin as in the
Windsor drawing, a long black cloak with fur collar reaching to the
knees, dark hose and shoes, and the collar and jewel of the Garter
round his neck. He grasps a gold-headed staff in both hands, and
stands on a terrace with a low parapet and a pavement of black and
red tiles, overlooking a distant landscape consisting of wooded country
and a land-locked harbour or estuary of a river with ships. His coat
of arms is in the top left-hand corner, and in the right an inscription
giving his titles and offices, as Lord Privy Seal and Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, and the date 1542. The supposition that this
picture is a copy after a lost original by Holbein is probably correct;
it is quite in his manner, though in workmanship it in no way reaches
to his mastery, the landscape background in particular showing an
indecisive touch quite unlike his firm handling. A copy of the head,
evidently taken from this picture, a small panel, 13⅛ in. × 9¾ in., was
lent to the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition, 1909 (No. 34),<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c020'><b>[436]</b></a> by
the Duke of Devonshire, which is inscribed across the brown background,
in an eighteenth-century hand, “<span class='sc'>Sir Thomas Moore</span>.” The
compilers of the Burlington Club catalogue do not accept the Cambridge
portrait on which it is based as a copy after Holbein, but as an
original work, and clearly by the same hand as the Earl of Surrey at
Knole, the full-length of a young man in Hampton Court Palace, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the Sir Thomas Gresham in Mercers’ Hall, with which the name of
Guillim Stretes has been connected, though on somewhat flimsy foundations.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c020'><b>[437]</b></a>
The Windsor head, however, is in such close accord with the
Fitzwilliam Museum picture that it seems reasonable to suppose that
the latter was based on it, or, rather, upon some painting of Holbein’s
for which it formed the preliminary study. There were two portraits
of the Earl in the Arundel Collection, both attributed to Holbein.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c020'><b>[438]</b></a></p>

Wyat was published, with the small circular woodcut of the poet after
a drawing by Holbein, which has been already described;<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c020'><b>[439]</b></a> but otherwise
the only dated portrait of this year is the one of the young man
with the falcon at the Hague, though there are several which must
have been painted shortly before his death. Those of Dr. John
Chamber and Sir William Butts and his wife must have been produced
in 1542 or the earlier half of 1543, while others, such as the
“Elderly Man” at Berlin, the small portrait of an English lady at
Vienna, and the Simon George at Frankfurt, may be attributed with
some certainty to the last seven or eight years of Holbein’s life. It is
probable, too, that he painted at about this time another portrait of
the Prince of Wales. No such painting now exists, but the full-faced
head with a cap in the Windsor Collection<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c020'><b>[440]</b></a> represents Edward as a
boy of about five or six years of age, and certainly older than in the
Hanover picture, while in the profile head with cap and feather in
the same collection of drawings,<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c020'><b>[441]</b></a> which forms the basis of numerous
portraits in the National Portrait Gallery and elsewhere, the boy seems
even older, though he was only six at the time of Holbein’s death.</p>

<p class='c023'>The portrait of an Unknown Man, aged fifty-four, in the Berlin
Gallery (No. 586 I) (<a href='#pl-29a'>Pl. 29 (1)</a>),<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c020'><b>[442]</b></a> is another work of great power in its
suggestion of life-like portraiture, and of high technical excellence. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>is shown to the waist, slightly turned to the right. The face is a
dignified one, with a long nose, and a slight droop in the right eyelid,
and a look of melancholy absorption about his dark grey eyes. The hair
and long beard are black, the latter with numerous grey hairs finely
indicated with all Holbein’s customary minute care. The hands are
thrust out of sight within the sleeves. His doublet, of which only the
lower part of the sleeves is visible, is of ruby-red silk or satin, over which
is a black or dark-brown coat with bands of black velvet, and lined
with a patterned watered silk. The black cap has gold tags. The plain
background is a greyish-blue, and on either side of the head is inscribed
in gold lettering, “<span class='fss'>ÆTATIS · SVÆ · 54</span>.” On the back of the panel
are the letters “W.E.P.L.C.,” apparently in a sixteenth-century hand,
probably the mark of some early English collector. The same letters
appear on the back of the portrait of Robert Cheseman at the Hague,
and on the portrait of a young man by Joos van Cleve in Berlin
(No. 633 A), which was formerly in the Marlborough Collection, where
it was at one time attributed to Holbein. Nothing of the early history
of the portrait under discussion is known. It belonged at one time
to Sir J. E. Millais, and was lent by him to the Holbein Exhibition in
Dresden in 1871, where it was acknowledged by the leading German
critics to be a splendid example of the master’s later English period.
It was purchased at the Millais sale, in 1897, for 3000 guineas for
the Kaiser Friedrich Museum. There is a poor and lifeless copy of
the head of this portrait in the collection of Mr. John G. Johnson, of
Philadelphia.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c020'><b>[443]</b></a> The panel is a pastiche, for the copyist has attached
the head of the Millais portrait to the body of the Unknown Young
Man aged twenty-eight in the Vienna Gallery. In the copy of the
head the hat is without the gold tags, the beard is slightly shorter,
and the sitter appears to be somewhat younger. In that of the body
the dress, hands, the rings, gloves, and book follow the Vienna picture
closely, but the copyist has removed the two rings on the little finger
of the right hand to the more usual ring-finger. Mr. C. Ricketts
regards it as “almost certainly modern. In draughtsmanship it is
without subtlety, the nostril is preposterous, the under lip like a
muffin.”<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c020'><b>[444]</b></a> Mr. F. J. Mather considers it to be old, and of fair quality.</p>

<p class='c023'>The portrait of an unknown English lady in the Imperial Gallery,

characterised by the most delicate brush-work and great charm and
richness of colour. She is shown to the waist, full-face, the body turned
slightly to the left, and her hands clasped in front of her. The dress is
of dark brown or puce, with the yoke and central hanging part of the
sleeves of black velvet. The sleeves from the elbow are of red velvet
slashed with white at the wrists. She wears a French head-dress of
white and gold, with black fall, closely resembling the one in the portrait
of Catherine Howard. The hair is a dark reddish brown. At her
breast is suspended a circular gold ornament upon which is represented
figures sacrificing at an altar, possibly of Holbein’s designing. The
background is a deep grey-blue, surrounded by a frame imitating
stonework. It has no inscription.</p>

<p class='c023'>Another small work of much beauty and delicacy of workmanship,

in Cornwall, in the Städel Institut in Frankfurt (No. 71),<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c020'><b>[447]</b></a> a profile
portrait to the left, showing the head and shoulders only, and the
right hand, in which the sitter holds a carnation. He has dark, closely-cropped
hair and pointed beard, with a black cap over the right ear,
elaborately ornamented with a white feather, many gold tags, an oval
medallion with a representation of Leda and the Swan, and a small
bunch of enamelled pansies. His dress is a rich one, and the open
collar of the shirt is covered with black embroidery of a floral pattern
of conventional design. The background is of greenish blue, and
some letters of a two-lined inscription, of later date than the painting,
mutilated by the reduction of the panel, which appears to have been
originally round, can still be traced, including the letters NOB and part
of the painter’s signature, “<span class='fss'>IOHA : H.</span>” It was acquired in 1870
from the Brentano-Birckenstock sale. The original study for the
head is in the Windsor Collection,<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c020'><b>[448]</b></a> and shows the same slight frown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>wrinkling the forehead as in the picture. The hairs of the moustache
are very carefully drawn, but the beard only shows a few days’ growth.
It is inscribed at the bottom, in cursive writing, “S. George of
Cornwall.”</p>

<p class='c023'>The portrait of Dr. John Chamber or Chambre in the Imperial
Gallery, Vienna (No. 1480) (<a href='#pl-30'>Pl. 30</a>),<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c020'><b>[449]</b></a> is one of Holbein’s most
powerful portraits of old men, the deeply-lined, clean-shaven face
being full of individuality. He is shown to the waist, turned three-quarters
to the right, in a plain black doctor’s cap, which covers the hair
and hides all but the lobe of the ears, and a black gown with brown fur
collar; and he holds a pair of grey gloves in his hands. The background
is a very dark blue, and is inscribed, on either side of the head,
“<span class='fss'>ÆTATIS SVE 88</span>.” The date of John Chamber’s birth has not been
traced, but the portrait was probably painted in 1541 or 1542, when
Holbein was engaged upon the big “Barber-Surgeons” picture, in
which Chamber is introduced in much the same position as in the
Vienna portrait. He died at an advanced age, well over ninety, in
1549. He was one of the King’s physicians, and his name was the
first on the roll of six doctors who in 1518 received letters patent
from the Crown giving them the privilege of admitting other physicians
to practise medicine in London, which was the original foundation of
the Royal College of Physicians. Chamber was joint author with
Dr. Butts and two others of a manuscript “Pharmacopœia” for the
use of Henry VIII. As Court physician he attended Anne Boleyn at
Greenwich Palace at the birth of the Princess Elizabeth, and it was
he who reported to the Privy Council the critical condition of Jane
Seymour when Edward VI was born. He married Joan Wardell in
1545, when he was nearly ninety, and their son was christened in the
following year, both he and his wife dying within a few weeks of one
another in 1549. His career, however, was more remarkable for the
many religious preferments he gained, than for his medical skill.
Born in Northumberland, he became a priest in early life, and
was a Fellow, and afterwards Warden, of Merton College, Oxford.
In 1502 he went to Italy and graduated in physic in Padua. On
his return to England he succeeded Linacre as the King’s chief
physician. In 1522 he was Canon of Windsor, in 1536 Dean of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Collegiate Church of St. Stephen, and later on Archdeacon of Meath.
A very excellent copy of this portrait is in the possession of Merton
College, Oxford, and was included in the Oxford Exhibition of Historical
Portraits in 1904 (No. 27). It is inscribed on the back: “Dr. Chamber,
phisician of King Henry VIII, copied from Hanns Holbein’s original
by H. Reinhart. The original, once belonging to the collection of King
Charles I, was, together with several other pictures of the same master,
after the execution of this Monarch, sold and became the property of
Archduke Leopold, Stadtholder of the Low Countries, from whence by
legacy it passed into the Gallery of the Emperors of Austria (Ob. 1549).”
The original portrait, however, does not appear at any time to have
been included in the collection of Charles I, but it formed part of the
wonderful series of works by Holbein got together by Thomas Howard,
Earl of Arundel. In the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> the date
of his birth is given as 1470, while the Oxford catalogue suggests the
date 1469, but neither can be correct, or otherwise the date of the
Vienna picture would be 1557 or 1558, fourteen years or so after
Holbein’s death. If the age of the sitter, eighty-eight, as given on
the panel, is correct, and it is accepted that the portrait was painted
about 1542, Chamber must have been born about 1454. The Merton
College copy was exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition,
1901-2 (No. 155), as a work of the school of Holbein. In 1894 the
Royal College of Physicians became possessed of a miniature portrait
of Chamber, painted on the back of the ten of clubs, and said to be by
Isaac Oliver. This is a careful copy of the Vienna picture, and has
a long Latin inscription, giving Chamber’s titles, and the date of his
death, round the frame. The original, when in the Arundel Collection,
was engraved by Hollar (Parthey, 1372), with the inscription
“D. Chambers Anno Ætatis Svæ 88. Holbein pinxit.” In the
Arundel inventory it is described as “Doctore John Chambers.” It
is possibly one of the pictures which remained on the Continent after
the death of the Countess of Arundel in 1654.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF DR. JOHN CHAMBER</div>
<p class='c023'>The portraits of Sir William and Lady Butts,<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c020'><b>[450]</b></a> which have suffered,
more particularly the former, from coarse repainting, are probably
of about the same date as the Dr. Chamber, for Butts is also one of
the prominent figures in the “Barber-Surgeons” group. The portrait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>of the husband has an inscription which has been repainted by an
ignorant copyist, and now reads “<span class='fss'>ANNO ATATS SVE LIX</span>.” Unfortunately,
as in the case of Chamber, the year of Butts’ birth is not known,
so that the exact date of the portrait cannot be proved. It is given
in the National Portrait Gallery Catalogue as 1485 (?). His tombstone
at Fulham bears only the date of his death, 1545. The portraits
show the heads and shoulders only. Sir William is represented in
profile to the right, in black cap and furred gown, and a heavy gold
chain upon his shoulders. His face is clean-shaven, and his grey hair
almost covers the ears. Lady Butts is painted almost full-face, but
turned slightly to the left. She wears the angular English head-dress
with black fall, a plain dress with fur-trimmed mantle, and a large
enamelled rose at her breast. Above her head is inscribed “<span class='fss'>ANNO
ÆTATIS SVE LVII</span>.” Both portraits were in the National Portrait
Exhibition, 1866, lent by Mr. W. H. Pole-Carew, and are now in the
collection of Mrs. John Gardner, Fenway Court, Boston, U.S.A.
They are about 18 in. × 14 in., and the green backgrounds and inscriptions
of both pictures have been badly repainted. There is a
good copy or replica of Sir William in the National Portrait Gallery<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c020'><b>[451]</b></a>
(No. 210), and copies of both husband and wife, apparently seventeenth-century
work, in the collection of Mr. F. A. Newdegate-Newdigate,
at Arbury, Warwickshire. There is no head of Butts among
the Windsor drawings, but that collection contains a masterly one
of his wife,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c020'><b>[452]</b></a> in which the lines of the face are very strongly marked.
She was a daughter of John Bacon of Cambridgeshire. The portrait
of their third son, Edmund Butts, of Thornham, Norfolk, who died at
the age of thirty in 1549, is in the National Gallery (No. 1496), and is
regarded as a work of that little-known English painter John Bettes.
This portrait is dated 1545, and the age of the sitter is given as twenty-six,
and on a card on the back is the inscription “<i>faict par Johan
Bettes Anglois</i>.”<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c020'><b>[453]</b></a></p>

Prince Frederick Duleep Singh lent a portrait (No. 30), also dated 1545,
said to represent Edmund Butts, and attributed by the owner to Bettes.
The armorial bearings on this picture indicate a member of the Butts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>family, but the person represented is certainly not the same as in the
National Gallery portrait, nor do the two appear to be the work of the

<div class='sidenote'>PORTRAIT OF SIR WILLIAM BUTTS</div>
<p class='c023'>Dr. Butts was in receipt of a salary of £100 a year from the King,
and was the favourite physician about the Court. He was a native
of Norfolk, and educated at Cambridge. Many prescriptions in his
handwriting are preserved in the British Museum. He appears as
one of the characters in Shakespeare’s <i>Henry VIII</i> (Act v. sc. 2),
and his name occurs in a number of contemporary letters. Thus, in
1537, the Earl of Shrewsbury wrote thanking Cromwell “for asking
the King to licence Dr. Buttes to come to him”;<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c020'><b>[454]</b></a> and on October 6,
1542, the Earl of Southampton wrote to Wriothesley from York, when
upon the expedition against Scotland: “Recommend me to Butts,
and thank him for his pills. I would not have foregone them at this
time for all the good I have.”<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c020'><b>[455]</b></a> In spite of the pills, however, the
Earl died at Newcastle nine days later.</p>

<p class='c023'>A small half-length portrait of an Unknown Man in the Basel
Collection (No. 327),<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c020'><b>[456]</b></a> belongs to the later period of Holbein’s English
residence. He is turned three-quarters to the left, and wears the
customary dark fur-lined surcoat and black cap, and dark purple
sleeves, and holds his gloves and a paper, upon which the inscription
is now illegible, in his clasped hands. The beard, moustache, and
hair are dark. This picture, which was purchased in Basel in
1862, has been more than once restored, so that Holbein’s handiwork
has suffered considerably. Another small picture which is also
now in a damaged state is the portrait of a young English lady
in the collection of Count Lanckoronski in Vienna,<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c020'><b>[457]</b></a> which was
regarded by Woltmann as probably by Holbein, but when exhibited
in the Dresden Exhibition of 1871 was declared by the critics to
be a genuine work. It is similar in style to the small portrait of a
Lady in the Vienna Gallery, and of about the same date. She is
shown at half-length, turned a little to the spectator’s right, with
clasped hands, and wearing a dark dress with red puffings and gold
tags from shoulder to wrist, and a French hood with bands of gold
ornaments and a black fall. Round her neck is a gold chain with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>pendant with seven flat stones, a second gold chain, and a large brooch
fastened at her breast with a cameo of a double head, a young man’s
shown full-face, attached to one of a lady in profile. Across the
plain green background, on either side of her head, is inscribed “<span class='sc'>Anno
etatis svæ xvii</span>.” In appearance she is stolid and unattractive, but
this may be partly due to the present state of the picture.</p>

<p class='c023'>There remains one other portrait of a lady of about this date—that
of Lady Rich,<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c020'><b>[458]</b></a> which until 1912 had been for many years in the
possession of the Moseley family at Buildwas Park, Shropshire. The
sitter is represented to the waist, slightly turned to the right, and
wears the English diamond-shaped hood with black fall, and a black
dress with a gold medallion decorated with the figures of a man and
woman by a corpse, which, according to Wornum, are “exquisitely
put in.”<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c020'><b>[459]</b></a> According to the same writer, it is “a fine expressive
portrait, with a thin rich carnation.” It is painted on wood, 17 in.
by 13 in., and has suffered some retouching. The face is a most
determined one, as can be seen from the fine preliminary drawing in
the Windsor Castle Collection.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c020'><b>[460]</b></a> Lady Rich was the daughter and
heiress of William Jenks or Gynkes, a rich London grocer, and she
married, in 1535, Lord Chancellor Rich, of notorious memory, who
helped to ruin many of the prominent men of his day, such as More
and Fisher. In the seventeenth century the portrait became the
property of the Rev. Herbert Croft, Bishop of Hereford, whose granddaughter,
Elizabeth Croft, married Acton Moseley, of Staffordshire.
In 1792 the portrait, with some other pictures, was bequeathed by
Sir Archer Croft to his cousin, Mr. Walter Michael Moseley. The
latter’s descendant, Captain H. R. Moseley, parted with the picture
in 1912, and it is now in an American collection.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c020'><b>[461]</b></a> It was last
exhibited at the National Portrait Exhibition at South Kensington in
1866 as a portrait of “Queen Katherine of Arragon.” There is also
a drawing of her husband, Richard Rich,<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c020'><b>[462]</b></a> at Windsor, and Holbein
must almost certainly have painted his portrait, but all traces of it
have been lost. A version of it was among the pictures destroyed
by fire at Knepp Castle in 1904.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S SELF-PORTRAITS</div>
<p class='c023'>Among the very last works from Holbein’s hand must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the various miniature portraits of himself, dated 1543, described in
the next chapter.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c020'><b>[463]</b></a> The self-portrait in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence,<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c020'><b>[464]</b></a>
which is evidently founded on one of them, or on one of the
small oil-paintings, now lost, has few pretensions, in the writer’s
opinion, to be regarded as an original work, though it is, of course,
possible that beneath the brush-work of some later and inferior painter
there may be an original work by Holbein now practically obliterated.
It is only right, however, to point out that Dr. Ganz considers it to
be an original though damaged drawing, and other writers are in
agreement with him. It is in coloured crayons on a gold ground,
and the comparatively modern inscription with the date 1543 has been
painted over an earlier one, which can be still traced below. Dr. Ganz
suggests that it is probably one of the two portraits which Van Mander
saw in Amsterdam in 1604.</p>

<p class='c023'>Of far greater interest is the recently-discovered portrait, first published
in 1912 by Dr. Ganz,<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c020'><b>[465]</b></a> which he considers to be a genuine self-portrait
by Holbein, hitherto unknown. The likeness both to the
numerous miniatures and to the Uffizi portrait is so great that the
attribution is most certainly the correct one. It is in all ways much
more attractive than the last-named work, and has far greater vitality
and a more subtle expression of character. It is a drawing of the
head and shoulders only, turned slightly to the spectator’s right, and
the painter is wearing a dark fur-lined cloak and black cap. Part of
the left hand only is shown. It is a coloured-crayon drawing touched
with water-colour, on white paper which has been covered with a
flesh-coloured ground. The paper has a Zürich water-mark, and was
only manufactured between 1536-1540, so that the date of the drawing
can be fixed with some accuracy, and was very probably done in Basel
during Holbein’s short visit home in the autumn of 1538. It has,
unfortunately, suffered considerable damage, and here and there has
been touched up with Indian-ink. On the top right-hand comer of
the blue background is inscribed, in a later hand, “H. H. 15 ...” It
was purchased in England in the summer of 1910, and is now in Basel
in the collection of Dr. Rudolph Geigy-Schlumberger.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c020'><b>[466]</b></a></p>

inventory.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Several portraits by Holbein, which so far have not been traced,
were etched by Hollar when they were in the Arundel Collection, and
these prints, in the absence of the originals, form invaluable records
for the use of students. Some few of them, however, though Hollar
has placed Holbein’s name on them, cannot have been painted by
him, as, for instance, the portrait of Thomas Chaloner,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c020'><b>[467]</b></a> which is dated
1548. All the more important of them are reproduced by Dr. Ganz
in his <i>Holbein</i> (1912),<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c020'><b>[468]</b></a> and several have been already described in
these pages. Among those remaining there is one of an unknown
bearded man in a black cap,<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c020'><b>[469]</b></a> and two of unnamed boys.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c020'><b>[470]</b></a> The second
of these boys, whose head is turned three-quarters to the left, appears,
from the details of the dress he is wearing, to be a Swiss. Holbein’s
original silver-point study for the portrait from which the etching was
taken is in the Louvre, and is dated 1520. The connection between
the two was first pointed out by Dr. Ganz.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c020'><b>[471]</b></a> The circular portrait of
Sir Anthony Denny is inscribed “<span class='fss'>ANNO 1541 ÆTATIS SVÆ 29</span>.”<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c020'><b>[472]</b></a> The
original painting, a small roundel, descended, according to Mr. W.
Barclay Squire, to the Howards of Greystoke Castle, and is now in
the collection of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, junr. There is an old copy
of it at Longford Castle.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c020'><b>[473]</b></a> The large print of an elderly, grey-bearded
man, with fur coat, and cap with a feather,<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c020'><b>[474]</b></a> is usually said to
represent Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, but though it bears
considerable likeness to the authentic portraits of him, the attribution
is doubtful. There are several portraits of English ladies among
Hollar’s work. Of one, in which the sitter is turned to the right,
and is wearing a round head-dress surmounted by a flat black cap
with a large feather,<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c020'><b>[475]</b></a> there is no study known, but for two others,
which Hollar has reproduced as small roundels, the preliminary
drawings are to be found in the Windsor Collection, one of them of
an unknown lady, full-face, wearing the angular head-dress,<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c020'><b>[476]</b></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the other the drawing inscribed “The Lady Mary after Queen.”<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c020'><b>[477]</b></a>
The profile portrait of a lady, which has been considered by some
writers to represent Anne of Cleves,<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c020'><b>[478]</b></a> does not appear to be after
an original by Holbein, though Hollar has placed his name on it.
It is possible, though not very probable, that some of these
circular etchings were based on the drawings, and not on finished
pictures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM’S COLLECTION</div>
<p class='c023'>Holbein’s practice during his last English period seems to have
been devoted almost entirely to portraiture, so that an entry in an
inventory of the Duke of Buckingham’s pictures at York House, made
in 1635,<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c020'><b>[479]</b></a> is of exceptional interest, as it shows that he did occasionally
paint subjects other than portraits. It runs as follows: “Hans
Holbin.—Jupiter and Jo in Water Coulers.” This picture, of which
all traces are lost, was hanging in the Vaulted Room. The Duke
possessed a number of other works by or attributed to Holbein, but
unfortunately the entries in the inventory are so tantalisingly vague
that it is impossible to gather much information about them, though
two of them seem to have been portraits of Steelyard merchants.
They included “Erasmus Rotterodamm after Holbin”; “A Dutchman
Sealing a Letter” (possibly the John of Antwerp now at Windsor);<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c020'><b>[480]</b></a>
“A Rare piece, being a Dutchman”; “A Queen”; “An other Lady”;
“A little picture in Linnen”; and “A little picture of Holbin himself,”
which was probably one of the miniatures. With the exception
of the last-named, all are described as by “Holbin” or “Hans
Holbin.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE “DANCING PICTURE”</div>
<p class='c023'>Another subject-picture by Holbein is mentioned by Evelyn in his
<i>Diary</i>, but so vaguely that it is impossible to guess what it could have
been. He says, under the date May 8, 1654: “I also call’d at Mr.
Ducie’s, who has indeede a rare collection of the best masters, and one
of the largest stories of H. Holbein.” This, however, may have been
some picture similar to “The Battle of Spurs” at Hampton Court,
attributed to Holbein in Evelyn’s day, and not a genuine work of the
master. His judgment was not always infallible, as he speaks of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>well-known “Dancing Picture,”<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c020'><b>[481]</b></a> which he saw at the Duke of Norfolk’s
at Weybridge (23rd August 1678) as “that incomparable painting of
Holbein’s.”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f481'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r481'>481</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This picture was traditionally said to have been begun in
France by Janet (Clouet), and Vertue thought it might have been
retouched by Holbein, “as it was probably painted for his patron, the
Duke of Norfolk, from whom it descended immediately to the Earl of
Arundel, out of whose collection the father of the present possessor
(Colonel Sotheby) purchased it.” (See Walpole, <i>Anecdotes</i>, ed.
Wornum, i. p. 95.) It was lent to the Tudor Exhibition, 1890, by
Major-Gen. F. E. Sotheby, No. 145. The only entry in the Arundel
inventory which it is just possible might refer to this picture is “Un
quadretto con diverse figure Jocatori, etc.,” which is given to
Holbein.</p>

The old tradition that Holbein did not practise miniature
painting until after he had settled in England is probably
true. Van Mander says that it was only at a
late period, after he had entered the King’s service,
that he, who knew how to adapt himself almost to
everything, took up the art of miniature painting, in
which he had before done nothing. At that time he met at the
Court a very famous master in this art, named Master Lukas.
“With Lukas he kept up mutual acquaintance and intercourse,
and learned from him the art of miniature painting, which, since
then, he pursued to such an extent, that in a short time he as
far excelled Lukas in drawing, arrangement, understanding, and
execution, as the sun surpasses the moon in brightness.”<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c020'><b>[482]</b></a> Seventy
years later Sandrart repeated this statement, which he evidently
took from Van Mander’s book. The Master Lukas in question
was undoubtedly Lucas Hornebolt, who was in the employment of
the King throughout the whole period of Holbein’s residence in
England. So far, the only pictures extant which have been attributed
with some certainty to the studio of Lucas and Gerard Hornebolt are
the portraits of Henry VIII, of the type of the Warwick Castle portrait,
when that monarch was drawing towards the end of his life; but the
sister, Susanna, wife of John Parker, Yeoman of the Robes, and one
of the King’s bowmen, was well known in her day as an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>miniaturist, while Guicciardini speaks of Lucas as not only a very
great painter, but as exceptionally good in the art of illuminating, so
that it is extremely probable that a number of the miniatures still in
existence, representing Henry, his wives, and members of his Court,
which though very excellent, have not the brilliance of execution and
the unfailing insight into character which mark the few genuine
miniatures by Holbein, were the work of the members of this family.
Guicciardini published his book only twenty-four years after Holbein’s
death, so that his account of the position they occupied at Henry’s
court, and the estimation in which they were held in England, borne
out as it is by the royal accounts, is evidently an accurate one.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f482'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r482'>482</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Quoted by Woltmann from Van Mander, i. p. 407; English translation, p. 370.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Further confirmation of the fact that Holbein was famous for his skill
in miniature painting during his residence in England is to be found
in a manuscript “Treatise concerning the Arte of Limning,” which was
written, at the request of Richard Haydock, by Nicholas Hilliard, the
first and one of the finest of English native-born miniature painters,
who was born in all probability in 1537, and so was a boy of six when
Holbein died, and based his art on Holbein’s own practice. This
treatise, which was first published in its entirety by Dr. Philip
Norman in the first annual volume of the Walpole Society, 1911-12,
from the original manuscript in the Edinburgh University Library, was
probably written by Hilliard between 1598-1602. The manuscript, which
is not in the miniaturist’s own hand, is dated 18th March 1624. In it
Hilliard extols “King Henry the eight a Prince of exquisit jugment and
Royall bounty, soe that of cuning stranger even the best resorted unto
him, and removed from other courts to his. Amongst whom came the most
excelent Painter and limner Master Haunce Holbean the greatest Master
Truly in both thosse arts after the liffe that ever was, so Cuning in
both together and the neatest; and therewithall a good inventor, soe
compleat for all three, as I never heard of any better then hee. Yet
had the King in wages for limning Divers others, but Holbean’s maner
of limning I have ever imitated and howld it for the best, by Reason
that of truth all the rare Siences especially the arts of Carving,
Painting, Goudsmiths, Imbroderers, together with the most of all the
liberall Siences came first unto us from the strangers, and generally
they are the best and most in number. I heard Kinsard [Ronsard?] the
great French poet on a time say, that the Ilands indeed seldome bring
forth any Cunning man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>but when they Doe it is in high perfection; so then I hope there maie
come out of this ower land such a one, this being the greatest and

<div class='sidenote'>“MINIATURA, OR ART OF LIMNING”</div>
<p class='c023'>Still further proof of Holbein’s fame as a limner or miniature
painter is to be found in a manuscript written by Edward Norgate,
called “Miniatura or the Art of Limning,” now among the Rawlinson
MSS. in the Bodleian Library, dedicated to Henry Frederick, Earl of
Arundel. Other versions of this treatise on the “Art of Limning”
are in the British Museum (Harl. MSS., No. 6000); in the possession
of the Royal Society, which came from the Arundel Collection; and
elsewhere. Norgate based a considerable part of his treatise on the
earlier one by Hilliard. “The incomparable H. Holbein,” he says,
“who, in all his different and various methods of painting, either in
oyle, distempre, lymning or crayon, was, it seems, so general an
artist as never to imitate any man, nor ever was worthily imitated
by any.”<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c020'><b>[484]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Van Mander is, no doubt, correct in saying that Holbein received
instruction in the art of miniature painting from Lucas Hornebolt,
and that he had not practised it until he came to England; though
Hornebolt had nothing to teach him but the practical use of a medium
in which, as applied to portraiture, he had until then had very little
experience. There is no evidence to show that he produced true
miniatures while in Basel, though there is one attributed to him in the
collection of the late Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, a portrait of a Baseler,
a certain Arnold Franz, described below, which affords possible proof
that he did so. Such an isolated example as this, however, may have
been painted during one of his later visits to Basel, or it may represent
one of the members of the German colony in London. Several of his
small circular oil paintings, almost the size of the true miniature, have
been described in earlier chapters,<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c020'><b>[485]</b></a> so that he was already skilled in
working on a small scale, and within it of producing a life-like
portrait, of the utmost delicacy and truth to nature, while his
extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>skill and precision in rendering with most minute yet masterly touches
of the brush all the details of the sitter’s costume, jewellery, and
accessories, must have left him little to learn when he began to work
in the new medium. It is evident that he soon set up a standard of
excellence in this field which both his contemporaries and the

<p class='c023'>His miniatures are now of the greatest rarity, though there are
many in various English collections which still wrongfully bear his
name, given to them in less critical days, when every portrait, great
and small, dating from Tudor times, was ascribed to him. In certain
of these, very possibly Holbein’s original handiwork has been buried
beneath repairs and repaints by later and less skilful hands. No
doubt a number of others have been lost, for so delicate and small an
object of art as a miniature is soon damaged or mislaid; though
against this must be set the fact that many of them were kept in
specially-made ivory boxes, and so would not easily suffer destruction.
The number of them which, from the perfection of their execution,
can be said with some approach to certainty to be from his brush,
can be counted almost on the fingers of one’s hands. These include
the portraits of Mrs. Pemberton; the two sons of the Duke of Suffolk,
Henry and Charles Brandon; Lady Audley; Queen Catherine Howard;
Sir Thomas More; the portrait of an unknown youth in the Queen of
Holland’s collection; several of the painter himself, done in the last
year of his life, and two or three others. After these come several
which, though less perfect in draughtsmanship, have serious claims
to be considered as his work, and after these, again, there are those
fairly numerous examples which, though of good execution and of
real interest and value, have no pretensions to rank as works of
the great master. Some of these have been attributed tentatively
to such painters as the Hornebolts, Livina Teerlinc, Stretes, or
Bettes, though modern criticism has not succeeded as yet in disentangling
the works of these little masters the one from the other,
so that the various attributions are at present more or less mere
guesswork.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MINIATURES OF SIR THOMAS MORE</div>
<p class='c023'>The beautiful miniature of Sir Thomas More, rediscovered by Dr.
Williamson when in the Godolphin-Quicke Collection, and first
published by him in his <i>History of Portrait Miniatures</i>, which
is in the late Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan’s collection, has been already
described when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>speaking of the portraits of Sir Thomas.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c020'><b>[486]</b></a> A second miniature of More,
in the collection of the Duke of Buccleuch at Montagu House, was
first reproduced by Mr. Dudley Heath in <i>The Connoisseur</i>.”<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c020'><b>[487]</b></a> This,
though based, like the Pierpont Morgan miniature, on the Huth
portrait, shows some differences from both. It is smaller than the
other miniature, and the sitter appears to be some years older. The
eyes are more downcast and the head slightly bent, while the scanty
beard is whiter. In other respects the dress, consisting of black cap
and furred gown, and collar of SS with the Tudor rose, is the same.
Another interesting point about it is that it is painted, not in water-colours,
but in oil on a gesso ground, upon a metal plaque which
appears to be silver. It has, unfortunately, suffered to some extent
in the course of time, and has been retouched here and there, but it is
a fine example, very possibly by Holbein, showing, according to Mr.
Heath, “that vivid realism, yet reserve of expression, that sensitive
modulation of the tones and contours, that insistent yet flexible drawing
of the features, which constitute the sign-manual of the great portrait
painter.” Nothing seems to be known of the history of this miniature,
which was exhibited at South Kensington in 1862 (No. 2061), in the
Royal Academy Winter Exhibition in 1879 (Case L, 4), and at the
Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909 (Case C, 17). These miniatures
of More would seem to suggest that Holbein’s earlier biographers
were wrong in stating that he did not begin to practise in this branch
of art until after he had entered Henry VIII’s service. It has been
generally supposed that when he returned to England a second time
he saw little or nothing of the Chancellor, and if that is so, these
miniatures must have been painted between 1526 and 1528, when he
was at work on the big group of his first English patron’s family.
At that time, however, Holbein had no official connection with the
court, and was possibly not yet on terms of intimacy with the Hornebolts,
so that it seems more probable that any miniatures of More
from his hand were done between 1532, the date of Holbein’s return
to London, and 1534, when the ex-Chancellor was imprisoned in the
Tower. Another possible solution is that they were painted after
More’s death for friends or relations who desired a memorial of him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and were done from the oil painting or from the preliminary drawings
still in the painter’s possession.</p>

article,<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c020'><b>[488]</b></a> and was lent by the Duke of Buccleuch to the Burlington
Fine Arts Club Exhibition (Case C, 22). It represents George Nevill,
third Lord Abergavenny, and, as already noted,<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c020'><b>[489]</b></a> is founded on the fine
drawing in the collection of the Earl of Pembroke, for so long considered
to be a portrait of Thomas Cromwell. The face, which is that
of an old man, is turned three-quarters to the spectator’s right, and
is clean-shaven. His white hair is almost covered by the black cap,
on which is a gold jewel with three pendant pearls. He wears a black
fur-lined gown over a black doublet open at the throat, showing his
white shirt. On the left-hand side of the bright-blue background is
inscribed “G. Abergaveny.” It is painted, like nearly all miniatures
of the period, on a playing card, and is 1¾ in. in diameter. It
was purchased by its present owner, with some other miniatures, at
the Earl of Westmorland’s sale at Apethorpe Hall, Northamptonshire,
in 1892. It is in a perfect state of preservation, full of vitality, and
excellent in modelling, and has considerable claims to be regarded as
an original. The pale, high tones of the flesh colour are in marked
contrast to the lower tones of the oil miniature of Sir Thomas More
in the same collection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MINIATURE OF LADY AUDLEY</div>
<p class='c023'>The two almost similar miniatures of Catherine Howard, at
Windsor Castle (<a href='#pl-31'>Pl. 31 (4)</a>) and Montagu House, have been already
described;<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c020'><b>[490]</b></a> both are beautiful examples, and each one is almost
certainly from Holbein’s own hand, though the former has suffered
from restoration. In the royal collection at Windsor there are three
other miniatures which also can be given to him without any hesitation,
all three being masterpieces of the art of the limner; these are
the portraits of Lady Audley and the two Brandon boys. The
miniature of Lady Audley (<a href='#pl-31'>Pl. 31 (3)</a>),<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c020'><b>[491]</b></a> is of extraordinary delicacy in
handling and colour, and bears the stamp of Holbein in every minute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>and unerring touch. As Mr. Law says, “there was no other artist at
the court of Henry VIII, or indeed in Northern Europe, who could have
produced so exquisite a work of art.”<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c020'><b>[492]</b></a> She is shown to the waist,
turned to the right, with hands folded in front of her. Her richly-brocaded
dress is of pale crimson, with under-sleeves of dark grey
and white ruffles, and she wears a French hood trimmed with pearls,
and a black fall over her fair hair. Her double necklace is of almost
the same pattern as the one worn by Catherine Howard. There is
no inscription on the plain, deep blue background. It is 2½ in. in
diameter, and is painted on the back of the two of hearts. The identity
of the sitter is placed beyond doubt by the fine drawing, inscribed
“The Lady Audley,” in the Windsor Collection (<a href='#pl-37a'>Pl. 37 (1)</a>),<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c020'><b>[493]</b></a> in which
the position and features of the sitter, the costume and ornaments, are
almost exactly the same, while the colour of the dress in the miniature
agrees with the note in Holbein’s handwriting on the drawing—“damast
rot.” This drawing is one of the finest and most delicate among the
heads of women in the Windsor Collection—a long, handsome face, with
pointed chin and sharp nose, and very expressive eyes. Holbein has
carefully indicated the details of the ornaments she is wearing. Her
necklace is of elaborate workmanship, apparently a band of alternate
links of enamel and pearls arranged as flowers, with a large pendant with
inset facetted jewels and three hanging pearls. At her breast is a large
circular ornament of a somewhat similar design. The oil painting for
which the preliminary study was made, and from which the miniature
was possibly taken, is now lost. Elizabeth, Lady Audley, was the
eldest daughter of one who must have been in constant touch with
Holbein—Sir Bryan Tuke, the Treasurer of the Chamber, whose
portrait by him has been already described, and from whose hands
he received his salary. She married John Touchet, ninth Lord Audley.</p>

<p class='c023'>The portraits of the two young sons of the Duke of Suffolk, Henry
and Charles Brandon, are acknowledged on all sides to be among the
very finest of Holbein’s miniatures. Dr. Woltmann, indeed, considered
the one of the elder brother to be the best which ever came
from his brush. It is, he says, “the most beautiful miniature painting
by Holbein that is known to us, and exhibits more strikingly than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>any other his artistic style and his spirited and perfect mode of execution,
true in spite of all its delicacy.”<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c020'><b>[494]</b></a> This is certainly by no means
too high praise, for both miniatures are delightful renderings of childhood,
drawn with all Holbein’s keen perception, and faultless in their
precision of line and delightfulness of colouring. The elder boy, Henry
(<a href='#pl-31'>Pl. 31 (1)</a>),<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c020'><b>[495]</b></a> aged five, is shown to the waist, full-face, leaning with
his left arm on a table at his side, his head slightly bent in the same
direction. He is wearing a black velvet dress with green under-sleeves,
and a black hat with a white feather. His fair hair is cut
straight across his forehead, and there is a rather sad look in his eyes.
On the ledge of the table is inscribed, “<span class='fss'>ETATIS SVE 5 6
SEPDEM</span>,” and below, on the table-leg, “<span class='fss'>ANNO</span>” and the
date, which has been variously read by different writers. The younger
brother, Charles (<a href='#pl-31'>Pl. 31 (2)</a>),<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c020'><b>[496]</b></a> aged three, is also seen to the
waist and full-face. His dress is a
bluish grey braided in red, and with black cuffs. His flat black cap has
no feather; his hair, like his brother’s, is very fair, and his blue eyes
look straight at the spectator. There is a strong likeness between the
two. He holds in front of him a paper with the inscription “<span class='fss'>ANN
1541 ETATIS SVÆ 3 10 MARCI</span>.” Both miniatures are painted on a
playing card, 2 in. in diameter, and in each the background is the
usual bright blue. Their pedigree in the royal collection can be traced
back as far as Charles I, in whose catalogue they appear as: “Done
by Hans Holbein. Given to the King by Sir H. Vane. No. 64.
<i>Item.</i> Done upon the wrong light. Upon a round card, one of the
Duke of Brandon’s children, being in a purple habit laced with red
velvet lace, with both his hands before him. 2 inches.” “No. 65.
<i>Item.</i> Another fellow piece of the same Duke of Brandon’s children,
in a black cap and habit with green sleeves, leaning with his left arm
upon the table, bending his breast towards his left shoulder, on the
table written his age, and the year of our Lord, done upon the wrong
light.” They appear again in James H’s catalogue, No. 646, as:
“Two heads in one frame, in limning, being the sons of Charles Brandon,
Duke of Suffolk. By Holbein.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HENRY AND CHARLES BRANDON</div>
<p class='c023'>The boys were the sons of Charles Brandon, first Duke of Suffolk,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>who became brother-in-law of the King by his secret marriage in Paris
on May 13, 1515, with the young Queen Dowager of France, widow of
Louis XII; and their mother, Suffolk’s fourth wife, was Catherine,
only daughter and heiress of William, tenth Lord Willoughby de
Eresby. The year date on the elder boy’s portrait has been usually
read as 1535. It is so given by Wornum and Woltmann, and other
writers have followed them, but if the portrait represents Henry
Brandon, the date is quite impossible. Mary Tudor, the “French
Queen,” the Duke of Suffolk’s third wife, died on June 25, 1533,
and in September of the same year Brandon married Catherine Willoughby,
the mother of these two boys. In Burke, on the other hand,
it is stated that the marriage took place in 1535; but this appears
to be incorrect. The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> gives the date
of the elder boy’s birth as September 18, 1535, which date is fixed
by the <i>inquisitio post mortem</i> held after his father’s death in 1545;
so that it is quite impossible that the lad could have been five years
old in 1535. Mr. Ernest Law reads the date on the miniature as
possibly 1539; to the writer, however, who has not had the privilege
of examining the original, it appears, from careful examination of the
excellent reproduction in Mr. Law’s book, to be either 1543 or 1545,
the third figure being plainly a 4. Neither of these dates, however,
can be correct, and it is quite possible that at some time the inscription,
growing illegible, has been repainted, and that in so doing the
restorer has made a mistake. The lettering on both miniatures lacks
the precision of an original inscription by Holbein. It is generally
assumed that the two dates, “6 Sep” and “10 Marci,” refer to the
boys’ birthdays, and there is no difficulty with regard to the second
boy, Charles, who was born in March 1538, two and a half years after
his brother. The two miniatures have every appearance of having
been painted at about the same time, and it is to be expected that
the elder of the two would be painted first. The writer suggests,
therefore, that the correct date of the portrait of Henry is September
1540, and that of Charles, March 1541.</p>

<p class='c023'>The two boys were very carefully brought up in the Protestant
faith by their mother. Martin Bucer, the German reformer, was
appointed their tutor, and they were afterwards in the charge of
Thomas Wilson, who became Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth.
At a later period Henry was sent to Sir John Cheke, and was educated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>with Prince Edward, and finally entered St. John’s College, Cambridge,
where his brother afterwards followed him. While there the two
boys contracted that scourge of the sixteenth century, the sweating
sickness. On the occasion of the outbreak they were hastily removed
for safety to the Bishop of Lincoln’s palace at Brickdon, in Huntingdonshire,
but too late, for both developed the disease, and died together
in one bed, on the same day, July 11, 1551, the younger
within less than an hour of the elder. Their death at so early an age
made an extraordinary impression at the time, and a pamphlet on the
subject was published by their tutor, Dr. Walter Haddon. Peter
Martyr said of Henry that, with the exception of Edward VI, he was
the most promising youth of his day.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>DRAWING OF A FAMILY GROUP</div>
<p class='c023'>There is a very beautiful drawing of the boys’ mother in the Windsor
Collection,<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c020'><b>[497]</b></a> a head turned three-quarters to the left, wearing the
English angular head-dress with a band of pearls, and a second ornamented
band of which part of the pattern has been drawn in detail
by Holbein. The collar is elaborately braided with black velvet, and
a medallion is indicated at the breast. The brown eyes and the hair
have been put in with water-colour. The portrait for which it
was the original study has not been traced. There is a replica of this
head in the British Museum (No. 10),<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c020'><b>[498]</b></a> which was formerly in the
Robinson and Malcolm collections. In this connection, too, a second
drawing in the British Museum may be cited, which represents a
woman and children sitting on a bench (No. 8) (<a href='#pl-32'>Pl. 32</a>).<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c020'><b>[499]</b></a> It is in
Indian-ink on paper, 5¼ in. × 4¼ in., and comes from the Cosway and
Utterson collections. It has been reproduced by the Vasari Society,<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c020'><b>[500]</b></a>
with a note by Mr. Campbell Dodgson, and by Dr. Paul Ganz.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c020'><b>[501]</b></a> Mr.
Dodgson suggests that the scene represented is the interior of a
church. An effect of warm sunshine is skilfully suggested by the light
which falls from a window, not seen, on the right. The mother or nurse
is seated in the centre of the group, on a high-backed bench with
panelling of the Tudor “linen” pattern, a baby in long clothes held on
her lap. On her right a boy with a flat cap and feather, and puffed
sleeves, is seated, his left elbow resting on the arm of the bench. A
little girl stands in front of her, looking up, and on the left a
younger boy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>dressed like his brother, is standing, the whole making a group of the
greatest charm. It is described in the British Museum Catalogue as an
admirable example of Holbein’s earlier Basel period, but it is
evidently of later date, and the costumes are undoubtedly English. It
has been recently suggested by Mr. Peartree that the woman is “Mother
Jack,” nurse to Prince Edward.<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c020'><b>[502]</b></a> In features and costume she bears
considerable likeness to the unnamed drawing in the Windsor
Collection,<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c020'><b>[503]</b></a> which is supposed to be a portrait of that nurse. If
this supposition be correct, the baby would be the Prince of Wales,
and the date of the drawing about 1537; but this fails to account for
the three other children. Dr. Ganz considers it to be a group of
members of the Brandon family,<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c020'><b>[504]</b></a> and as far as the two boys are
concerned, this suggestion has something in its favour. The lad on the
right is by
no means unlike Henry Brandon. The position of the head and the
left arm are exactly the same as in the miniature, and the dress has
many points of resemblance. The second boy, too, has some likeness
to Charles, though he does not wear the velvet-braided costume of
the miniature. Again, however, there is a stumbling-block to this
theory in the presence of the two younger children, for the Duke’s
family by his fourth wife consisted of the two boys only. By his
second marriage with Anne, daughter of Sir Anthony Browne, he
had two daughters, Anne, afterwards Lady Powys, and Mary, afterwards
Lady Monteagle, and by his third wife, the King’s sister, he had
two other daughters, Frances, afterwards Countess of Dorset, and
Eleanor, afterwards Countess of Cumberland, but these ladies were
all too old for one of them to have been the little girl represented
in the drawing. Owing, no doubt, to the wrong date on the miniature of
Henry Brandon, Dr. Ganz ascribes this drawing to the year 1535, and
sees signs in the elder boy’s face of approaching illness, although no
such illness is recorded until the sudden one in 1551, when he was
nearly sixteen. Both explanations are ingenious, but neither is
entirely satisfactory. On the margin of the drawing, in a later hand,
is written—“exaltate Cedrus. H. Holbein,” which, apparently, is a
reference to Ecclesiasticus xxiv. 17, “Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in
Libano.”</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>The utmost perfection in miniature painting is to be found in the
portrait of Mrs. Robert Pemberton (#Pl. 33 (1)pl-33#),<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c020'><b>[505]</b></a> in the late Mr. J.
Pierpont Morgan’s collection (No. iv.), which bears in every touch the
unapproachable skill and rare individuality of the artist. It was
formerly in the collection of Mr. C. Heywood Hawkins, and at his sale
on May 15, 1904, realised £2750, afterwards passing into the
possession of Mr. Morgan, by whose courtesy it is reproduced in this
book. In the Hawkins Sale-Catalogue it was described as the portrait
of Frances Howard, Duchess of Norfolk, but without authority, for
there was no Duchess of Norfolk of that name in Holbein’s time. When
exhibited by Mr. Hawkins at South Kensington in 1865, it was described
in the catalogue as merely—“Portrait of a Lady, Anno Aetatis Suae 23.
Her coat of arms is affixed to the case.” This coat, described by Sir
Richard Holmes in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>,<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c020'><b>[506]</b></a> in a note
accompanying a reproduction of the portrait, is dated <span class='fss'>MDLVI</span>,
and in style
and painting is about a century later than the miniature. These
arms, as Sir Richard first pointed out, are those of the Pemberton
family. Further researches, undertaken by Dr. Williamson, and embodied
in his catalogue of Mr. Pierpont Morgan’s Miniatures, prove,
almost without doubt, that the lady represented was Mrs. Robert
Pemberton. He says: “The arms of the wyverns’ heads which are
quartered with those of Pemberton belong to the family of Jago di
Lago, gentleman, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire; and
Robert Pemberton, of Rushden, Northants, M.P. for Northampton
in 1478, married Alice, daughter and co-heir of this Jago di Lago....
Major-General R. C. B. Pemberton, to whom I am indebted for
these interesting references, is of opinion that the lady in the
miniature is Margaret, daughter of Richard Throgmorton, of Higham
Park, co. Northants, who was buried at Rushden, 27th October 1576. She
married Robert Pemberton, of Pemberton, co. Lancs., and of Rushden,
eldest son of William Pemberton, of the same places, and he died in
September 1594. The arms would be those of this Robert Pemberton,
whose grandfather certainly bore them.”<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c020'><b>[507]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>In this very beautiful little masterpiece the lady is shown
three-quarters face to the right, wearing a black velvet bodice and
small white linen cape, and a lawn collar and cuffs, embroidered with
a geometrical design in black. She has a red carnation fastened in her
dress, and round her neck a thin black cord with gold filigree ends,
and holds a single green leaf in her crossed hands. Her hair, which is
parted in the centre, is almost concealed beneath her white linen cap.
The background is, as usual, blue, and across it, in gold letters,
runs the inscription, “<span class='fss'>ANNO ETATIS SVÆ 23</span>.” It is painted on
the back of a playing card, and is still in its original frame,
decorated with white and black enamel and three pearls.</p>

<p class='c023'>The miniature in the Queen of Holland’s collection (<a href='#pl-31'>Pl. 31 (5)</a>)
equals, if it does not surpass, in the brilliance and delicacy of its
execution and in the subtlety of its characterisation, the portrait of
Mrs. Pemberton; in some ways, indeed, it is the most perfect example
of Holbein’s mastery of this branch of art which remains. Its
discovery was due to Sir Richard Holmes, who, in 1903, first
attributed it to Holbein, in a communication to the <i>Burlington
Magazine</i>,<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c020'><b>[508]</b></a> accompanied by a reproduction of the miniature. It
forms one of a collection of some four hundred, of which about fifty
are of English origin, in the royal collections of Holland at the
Hague. It represents a youth of about fifteen or sixteen, who so far
has not been identified. The head and shoulders only are shown, turned
three-quarters to the spectator’s right, the eyes cast down. The hair
is cut close, and the dress is a brown doublet trimmed with black,
with a small open, falling collar with white strings attached. There
is no inscription on the background. With the exception of slight
discoloration of the collar through the oxidization of the pigment,
this miniature is in faultless condition. “Its extraordinary power and
beauty,” says Sir Richard, “were manifest at first sight, and a close
examination has convinced me that it can be attributed only to
Holbein, of whose work in this branch of portraiture I have long been
a student, as well as of his crayon drawings. It has all the restraint
of power so characteristic of him, and the exquisite delicacy of line
combined with firmness and precision, which never united in the same
degree in any master with whose work I am acquainted.”<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c020'><b>[509]</b></a> The same
writer suggested that it is possibly the portrait of a member of the
family of one of the German merchants of the Steelyard. The facial
characteristics, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>appear to be more English than German, and it most probably represents
the son of some personage about Henry’s court. It was
exhibited at the Exhibition of Miniatures in Rotterdam in 1910, and
again at Brussels in 1912 (No. 846). Another fine miniature in the
Queen of Holland’s collection, the portrait of an unknown man in
black (Brussels Exhibition, No. 847), was first pointed out by Dr.
Williamson in his <i>History of Portrait Miniatures</i> as very probably the
work of Holbein; and since its exhibition at Brussels in 1912 the
attribution has been accepted by some of the leading Dutch critics.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c020'><b>[510]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S MINIATURES OF HIMSELF</div>
<p class='c023'>A fine miniature portrait of the artist himself, painted in the last
year of his life, is in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch,<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c020'><b>[511]</b></a> and was
exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, 1879 (Case F, 25),
and at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909 (Case C, 23). It is a
bust portrait, turned three-quarters to the left, the head facing the
spectator. He is represented in the act of painting, the left hand
supporting the right, and is dressed in a plain black costume with white
pleated collar and cuffs, and a round black skull-cap. He has dark
hair and a closely-cut beard. Across the blue background is inscribed,
“<span class='fss'>H.H. AN. 1543. ÆTATIS SVÆ 45.</span>” It was formerly in the collection
of Horace Walpole, and at the Strawberry Hill sale in 1842 was purchased
by Mr. W. Blamire, and when the latter’s collection was disposed
of in 1863 it passed into the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch.
It is one of the best of several similar miniatures, and is very fine in
execution, and has been usually ascribed to Holbein himself. The
best of all is in the Wallace Collection (Case B, 93) (<a href='#pl-33'>Pl. 33 (2)</a>),<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c020'><b>[512]</b></a> and
appears to be from the painter’s own hand. A number of copies are to
be found in various collections; one of them, in the Mayer van den Bergh
Collection, Antwerp, is reproduced by Dr. Ganz.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c020'><b>[513]</b></a> Woltmann considered
that the Montagu House portrait was “scarcely the original, but an
old and contemporaneous copy,”<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c020'><b>[514]</b></a> but it is too excellent in execution
to be the work of a mere copyist. There is a second and larger version
in the Buccleuch Collection, with the same date, 1543, also attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to Holbein. The first-named example may possibly be the small round
mentioned by Van Mander as being in Amsterdam in his day. Lucas
Vorsterman’s circular engraving was evidently based on this miniature
or the somewhat larger portrait now lost,<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c020'><b>[515]</b></a> of which the exceedingly
poor likeness of the painter in the Uffizi Gallery gives but a feeble echo.
The print follows the miniature closely, but is reversed, so that Holbein
is represented as painting with his left hand. Hollar’s engraving,
dated 1647, in which the painter’s left hand is omitted, was taken,
according to the inscription, from an original in the collection of the
Earl of Arundel, though Wornum was of opinion that it was based
upon Vorsterman’s version. Both are described in an earlier chapter.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c020'><b>[516]</b></a>
The inscription across the background in Hollar’s print—“<span class='sc'>HH. Æ 45.
AN<b>o</b> 1543</span>”—agrees with the second miniature in the Buccleuch Collection.
Van Mander states that Holbein painted with his left hand,
and in this Sandrart and Patin follow him, but that this was a legend
is proved by the original miniature in which the artist has represented
himself holding his brush. Vorsterman’s engraving, which appears
to bear out Van Mander’s statement, through his failure to reverse
his drawing on the wood block, if not the original source of the error,
may have helped to spread it. Sir George Scharf, however, suggested
another cause as the source of this tradition. “Most of the portraits
of Henry VIII,” he says, “more especially those attributed to Holbein,
have the light coming in from the spectator’s right, a circumstance
which may have tended, in some degree, to establish the tradition
that Holbein was left-handed. These are specified by Van der Dort
as done upon the wrong light.”<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c020'><b>[517]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The discovery of another miniature by Holbein was made by
Dr. G. C. Williamson in 1911,<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c020'><b>[518]</b></a> and is one of exceptional interest, as
it is an undoubted likeness of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, K.G.
(<a href='#pl-31'>Pl. 31 (6)</a>). It came from a private source, and is now in the late Mr.
Pierpont Morgan’s collection. It was fully described, and compared
with other portraits of Cromwell, by Mr. Lionel Cust in the
<i>Burlington Magazine</i>.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c020'><b>[519]</b></a> He is represented in a black cloak with fur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>collar, black cloth cap, and wearing the chain of the Garter with
the pendant George. The background is blue. It is about two
inches in diameter, painted on vellum or chicken-skin, pasted on
card. “It is encased,” says Mr. Cust, “in an ivory box, carved on
the back with a rose and other ornaments, similar to, though in no
way so fine or so rich as, the ivory box which contains the miniature
portrait of Anne of Cleves, lately bequeathed to the nation by Mr.
George Salting, and now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the
case, however, of Mr. Morgan’s portrait of Cromwell, the lower half
of the box has been separated from the lid, cut down, and set in a gold
frame, which is ornamented by a series of small deformed pearls.
This gold framework is the work of a highly-efficient goldsmith, but
hardly seems to date from the days of Henry VIII.” As Cromwell
is shown wearing the Garter chain and badge, of which order he was
made a knight in August 1537, the miniature was no doubt painted
at some date between August and December in that year, to commemorate
his election. In this connection it is of interest to note that
in Cromwell’s accounts, preserved in the Record Office, there is an entry
under 4th January 1538: “Hanns the painter, 40<i>s.</i>”<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c020'><b>[520]</b></a> This payment
would suggest that, in all probability, Holbein presented him
with this miniature as a New Year’s gift, and that in return he received
the forty shillings from his old patron as an acknowledgment.<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c020'><b>[521]</b></a> The
miniature is thus some three or four years later in date than the
portrait at Tyttenhanger, painted not later than the spring of 1534,
when he was Master of the Jewel House.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c020'><b>[522]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Unfortunately this miniature has suffered severely during its past
career, and has been so rubbed down that little of the details of the
dress or ornaments can now be distinguished beyond the mere outlines.
“The face,” says Mr. Cust, “is faded and also rubbed, but here the
skilful drawing of the features reveals a master-hand which could be
no other but Holbein’s. Very subtle, however, and recognizable are the
distinctive features of Thomas Cromwell, the vulgar nose, with its sunken
bridge, the cunning eyes with the puckered skin at their corners.”<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c020'><b>[523]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The scope of this book does not permit any detailed description
of the very numerous miniatures of Henry VIII and the members of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>his family which are to be found in various collections in England,
the more important of which have been publicly exhibited from time to
time. In the royal collection in Windsor Castle there are four of the
King himself, but none of them can be given to Holbein. Three of them
appear to have been painted immediately before Holbein’s first visit
to England, and the fourth shortly after his death. Two, in which
Henry is beardless, and of youthful appearance, were in Charles I’s
collection, and are entered in his catalogue as being among “the
limned pictures which my Lord of Suffolk gave to the King.” One of
them is inscribed, in two lines, “<span class='sc'>H.R. VIII. AN<b>o</b> ETATIS
XXXV<b>o</b></span>,” which gives the date as 1525-6; the other, which it
resembles closely, has no date, but merely “<span class='fss'>REX HENRICUS.
OCTAVVS</span>.”<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c020'><b>[524]</b></a> The third Windsor miniature is inscribed “<span class='sc'>H.R.
VIII. AN<b>o</b> XXXV</span>.” In the spandrils four golden angels, on a
bright red ground, are holding the letters H and K in golden cords,
and linked with true-lovers’ knots. Sir George Scharf considered these
initials to refer to the King’s last marriage, on July 12, 1543, with
Catherine Parr, and the “<span class='sc'>XXXV<b>o</b></span>” as referring, not to Henry’s
age, but to his regnal year. “The face,” he says, “at first sight
looks youthful, but it is fat, and, on careful inspection, has a worn
and very artificial appearance, as if means had been employed to
conceal age.”<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c020'><b>[525]</b></a> Mr. Wornum, on the other hand, considered the
numerals to refer to the King’s actual age, and not to his reign, and
the initial K to Katherine of Aragon.<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c020'><b>[526]</b></a> It is only possible to say of
the earlier of these miniatures that they are not the work of Holbein.
As to the real author of them, the name of one or other member of the
Hornebolt family can only be tentatively given, without any real proof
in support of it, beyond the fact that the Hornebolts were settled in
this country before 1526, the name appearing in the accounts of the
expenses of the royal household in that year, and that there appears
to have been no other foreign artist of like importance living in
London at that date. Mr. Lionel Cust, in the Burlington Fine Arts Club
Exhibition Catalogue, suggests the name of Jehan Perréal, or Jehan de
Paris, as the possible author of some of the early portraits in
miniature of the King, painted before Holbein’s arrival in England.
Perréal was over here at the time of the marriage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Louis XII, whose official painter he was, with Princess Mary Tudor,
for the purpose of designing the new Queen’s dresses. His visit,
however, could have been but a short one, and does not account for
miniatures of the year 1526.</p>

<p class='c023'>The fourth miniature of the King at Windsor is in oils on oak, 2¾ in.
in diameter, in which he is wearing a thin beard and whiskers. It is
inscribed, “<span class='fss'>HENR. 8 REX. ANGL. ÆTA. S: 57</span>.” Its date, therefore,
must refer to the last year of the King’s reign, 1546, though there is
a mistake in the age, as he never entered his fifty-seventh year. According
to Charles I’s catalogue, it was “supposed to be done by
Holben, and given to the King by my Lord Suffolk.” In type it
corresponds very closely to the portrait of Henry in St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, London. There is yet another miniature of the King at
Windsor, by Nicholas Hilliard, which appears to have been copied
from some lost original by Holbein or by Hornebolt. It is one of the
customary full-face versions, with beard, and is one of the four fine
miniatures which were appended to an elaborate jewel which Hilliard
executed in enamels and gold, possibly for Edward VI, representing the
Battle of Bosworth Field, which was bought by Charles I from Laurence
Hilliard, the painter’s son. The three other miniatures represent
Henry VII, Jane Seymour, evidently copied from the well-known
portrait by Holbein, and Edward VI, which recalls more than one of
the portraits of the young King usually attributed to Guillim Stretes.
The one of Henry VIII is inscribed in gold: “<span class='fss'>1536. ÆTATIS SVÆ 46.</span>”</p>

Fine Arts Club Exhibition by the Duke of Buccleuch, two of which are
attributed to Holbein. One is a reduced copy of Holbein’s portrait of
Henry belonging to Earl Spencer (Case C, 6). A second<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c020'><b>[527]</b></a> is inscribed
“<span class='sc'>H.R. VIII. AN<b>o</b> XXXV</span>,” and appears to be the original from
which the Windsor miniature, described above, was copied (Case C, 7).
It was formerly in the Magniac Collection. The catalogue suggests that
it is possibly the work of an illuminator of the French school. A
third (Case C, 25), with a very similar inscription, is evidently a
second copy of the same miniature. The fourth (Case C, 8
(<span class='fss'>D</span>)), forms one of a series of eight in an ebony frame, which
were formerly in the collection of Charles I. It is a full-face, with
grey beard, and, according to the royal catalogue, was “done by Hans
Holbein,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>given to the King by my Lord Suffolk.”<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c020'><b>[528]</b></a> The companion miniatures
represent Henry VII, Elizabeth of York (“copied by Hoskins after
an ancient ould coloured piece”), Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn
(also copied by John Hoskins “after an ould colured piece”), Queen
Mary (“done by Ant. More”), Edward VI, and Queen Elizabeth (“done
by Old Hilliard”). The “Henry VIII” is fine, and in the Burlington
catalogue is attributed to Holbein, but it is more probably another
copy from “an ould coloured piece” by the master. It has considerable
resemblance to the fifth miniature from Montagu House<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c020'><b>[529]</b></a>
(Case C, 2), also ascribed to Holbein, but not by him.</p>

<p class='c023'>The very fine miniature portrait of the King in the Pierpont
Morgan Collection was included in the same exhibition (Case B, 1).<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c020'><b>[530]</b></a>
Old tradition says that this portrait was presented by the King himself
to Anne of Cleves. Tradition in this case may be correct, though this
Queen is the least likely of all to have been the recipient of such a gift.
The correspondence with reference to the suggested marriages with
the Duchess of Longueville, the Duchess of Milan, and Anne herself,
shows that Henry always refused to send a portrait of himself while
such negotiations were in progress. His anxiety was to see a portrait
of the lady first, and, if possible, the lady herself, before making his final
decision, and to send one of himself before such final decision had been
made would have been too compromising. It is not likely, therefore,
that he sent one to Anne in Düren, and as he took the strongest aversion
to her directly he saw her, it is still less probable that she received
a gift of so personal a nature after she arrived in England. Dr.
Williamson, in his catalogue of Mr. Morgan’s miniatures, gives a very
interesting account of the history of this fine little portrait,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c020'><b>[531]</b></a> and the
companion one of Anne of Cleves, both at one time in the possession
of the Barrett family, of Lee Priory, Kent, and later in that of the
Meyricks, of Goodrich Court, to which reference has been made in an
earlier chapter.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c020'><b>[532]</b></a> Some years before the death of General Meyrick,
who had succeeded to the Goodrich Court Collection, the miniature
of Henry VIII disappeared, and was supposed to have been stolen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>It is said to have travelled as far as Vienna, but four years or so after
General Meyrick’s death it reappeared in England, and was repurchased
for the family, from whom, in 1906, it was acquired by
Mr. Morgan.</p>

<p class='c023'>It represents the head and shoulders only, full-face, with grey beard
and moustache. Henry wears a black cap trimmed with jewels, loops
of pearls, and a white feather, a brown fur coat over a grey doublet
embroidered with black, a narrow white collar, and a gold chain round
his neck. There is no inscription on the blue background. It is 1¼ in.
in diameter, and is still preserved within its original turned ivory box,
ornamented at top and bottom with the Tudor rose, and covered with
a piece of rock crystal. There is some resemblance between it and
the crayon drawing of the King at Munich, and, in the details of the
costume, to the large cartoon at Chatsworth and the full-face portrait
in Windsor Castle, which has been considered by some critics to be
a copy of a lost picture by Holbein, and by others as an original portrait
by some such court painter as Lucas Hornebolt. The differences
in the costume are slight, and the dress is in its main features the same.
Fine as this miniature is, it is difficult to ascribe it to Holbein himself;
it is more probably only an excellent old copy of a lost original, or the
work of some capable miniaturist adapted from one of Holbein’s
paintings.</p>

<p class='c023'>The miniature of Anne of Cleves, which is slightly larger than the
one of Henry VIII, and is enclosed within a similar turned ivory box
delicately carved to represent a Tudor rose, has been already described.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c020'><b>[533]</b></a>
It is of the finest workmanship, and may be given to Holbein with little
hesitation. It was included in the Burlington Club Exhibition, 1909
(Case B, 4), and the catalogue states that in all probability it was painted
in July 1539, at Düren. Holbein’s visit to that place was of longer
duration than was usual when he was sent to take likenesses of the
ladies who were candidates for Henry’s hand.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c020'><b>[534]</b></a> As a rule, he only
remained just long enough to make a study in coloured crayons, but he
stayed at Düren for a week or two, and so may have had time to paint
both the large portrait and the miniature, though it must be remembered
that he also painted or drew the lady’s sister, the Princess Amelia.
It is much more probable that the miniature was taken from the
larger portrait, or that both were done from some lost crayon study,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>than that the Louvre picture should have been painted from the
miniature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MINIATURES OF JANE SEYMOUR</div>
<p class='c023'>There are several miniatures of Queen Jane Seymour in existence, in
most cases attributed to Holbein, all, with one exception, closely
following the portrait of that Queen in the Vienna Gallery, upon which
they are evidently based. Among the best are two which were in the
Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition, lent by Mr. Vernon Watney and by
the Duke of Buccleuch. The former (Case B, 2),<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c020'><b>[535]</b></a> inscribed merely
“<span class='sc'>A<b>o</b>N XXV</span>,” is said to have belonged originally to the
Seymour family, and to have been given by Charles, Duke of Somerset,
to his granddaughter, Elizabeth Wyndham, wife of the Right Hon. George
Grenville, from whom it passed into the possession of the Duke of
Buckingham. It was afterwards in the Sackville Bale and Lumsden
Propert collections. Sir George Scharf considered this miniature to be
a portrait of Anne Boleyn, and regarded the “<span class='fss'>XXV</span>” as the
King’s regnal date, and not as that of the lady’s age;<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c020'><b>[536]</b></a> but the
likeness to Jane Seymour is stronger, though not very marked. Mr. C.
F. Bell points out<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c020'><b>[537]</b></a> that the likeness of the sitter to Lady
Hemingham or Heveningham
(“Henegham”), as she is represented in the fine drawing at Windsor,<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c020'><b>[538]</b></a>
is much more pronounced, and he suggests that the miniature was
painted from the portrait of that lady, taken from the drawing, which has
now disappeared. Mr. Watney’s miniature, however, closely resembles
the one belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch (Case C, 5),<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c020'><b>[539]</b></a> though the
latter has no inscription and the pendant jewel set with large pearls is
absent. This last portrait belonged to Horace Walpole, and by him was
regarded as representing Katherine of Aragon, and under that name it
passed from the Strawberry Hill sale into the hands of Mr. Blamire,
and afterwards into its present ownership. It appears to be, however,
an undoubted portrait of Henry’s third queen. Another miniature of
Jane Seymour was lent to the same exhibition by Mr. H. Dent-Brocklehurst
(Case B, 6),<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c020'><b>[540]</b></a> attributed like the others to Holbein, which
was also formerly in the possession of Horace Walpole. The portrait of
this queen is also among the four miniatures attached to the enamelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>jewel, of Nicholas Hilliard’s workmanship, in the royal collection at
Windsor, mentioned above. It is inscribed “<span class='fss'>ANŌ DNĪ 1536 ÆTATIS
SVÆ 27</span>,” which no doubt appeared on the original miniature by
Holbein, now lost, from which all these others are also derived.</p>

<p class='c023'>The miniatures of Catherine Howard have been already described.<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c020'><b>[541]</b></a> It
is doubtful whether Holbein painted Queen Catherine Parr, for the King
did not marry her until July 12, 1543, only a month or two before the
artist died. A miniature in the possession of Mr. H.
Dent-Brocklehurst, lent by him to the Burlington Fine Arts Club
Exhibition (Case B, 7), is said to represent this Queen and to be by
Holbein, but both attributions are probably incorrect. It is inscribed
“<span class='fss'>ANO XXXII</span>,” and if this is to be read as the regnal year, it
must have been painted between April 1540 and April 1541, and, if it
represents this Queen, more than two years before her marriage. She
wears a scarlet, black, and white circular French hood with black
fall, and cloth of gold dress. Sir George Scharf considered it to be a
portrait of Catherine Howard.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c020'><b>[542]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Several miniatures of Edward VI exist—there are three in the
Buccleuch Collection—though not one has been so far discovered from
the hand of Holbein himself. Most of them represent the boy at a
period after Holbein’s death, and the name of Guillim Stretes has
been suggested as their author.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c020'><b>[543]</b></a> The beautiful little circular drawing
of the Prince, at a very early age, in the Basel Gallery,<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c020'><b>[544]</b></a> is apparently
Holbein’s first study for a miniature which has now disappeared, and
may have been the “portrait of the Prince’s Grace” which the artist
presented to Henry VIII on New Year’s Day, 1539.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c020'><b>[545]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>LIVINA TEERLINC</div>
<p class='c023'>Certain of these miniatures, and others not described here, some
of them apparently copies after Holbein, while others are original
works, were no doubt produced by Susanna Hornebolt, Livina<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c020'><b>[546]</b></a> Teerlinc,
and Stretes, all three of whom were in turn much employed about the
court, and enjoyed royal pay. It has been impossible, so far, to
separate the works of these artists, or to find any starting-point in
the shape of a signed miniature from which any judgment of their
particular methods and style can be formed. What little is known
of Susanna Hornebolt has been given in an early chapter. Livina
Teerlinc, eldest daughter of the miniaturist, Simon Binnink of Bruges,
married George Teerlinc of Blankenberghe, near Bruges, and after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the death of her husband’s father, in 1545, they came to England.<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c020'><b>[547]</b></a>
She is mentioned by Vasari in a short passage as “Levina, daughter
of the above-named Master Simon of Bruges, who was nobly married
in England by Henry VIII, was held in great esteem by Queen Mary,
and is now in much favour with Queen Elizabeth,” an account which
Guicciardini copies and slightly elaborates.<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c020'><b>[548]</b></a> Her name does not occur
in the royal accounts, however, until Midsummer, 1547, under Edward
VI, when, as “maistris Levyn Terling paintrix,” she received a quarter’s
wages of £10. She held the same appointment under Mary and Elizabeth
and at the same salary, £40 a year. On New Year’s Day, 1556, she
presented Queen Mary with a small picture of the Trinity, and two
years later her New Year’s gift to Queen Elizabeth was a portrait
of her Majesty “finely painted upon a card,” for which she received
in return a silver-gilt casting-bottle weighing 2¾ oz. In 1561, on a
like occasion, there was given to the same Queen, “By Mrs. Levina
Terling, the Queenes personne and other personnages in a box fynely
painted,” which so pleased Elizabeth that she retained it in her own
keeping, and gave “Maistris Levyn Terling” in return a silver-gilt
covered salt-cellar weighing 5½ oz.<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c020'><b>[549]</b></a> George Teerlinc returned to Bruges,
and died there before 25th August 1580; and Mr. Weale conjectures
that his wife died before him, probably in England, but there is no
documentary evidence of this. In any case, Vasari, and Guicciardini
after him, were wrong in stating that while at the English court she
was “nobly married.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>In the case of Livina, as with Susanna Hornebolt, it is impossible
to point with certainty to any work as being indubitably from her hand.
The two beautiful miniatures in the Salting Collection representing two
little girls, sisters, aged five and four respectively, which were formerly
in the collection of Mr. C. H. T. Hawkins, were attributed by both
these owners to Livina Teerlinc, and were so described in the catalogue
of the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition (Case B, 5).<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c020'><b>[550]</b></a> The richness
of the costume indicates that they were the children of some
important personage about the court. Each one is dated “<span class='fss'>ANO DNI</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span><span class='small'>1590</span>,” and they are enclosed in a contemporary turned ivory case.
Dr. Williamson states that at one time they had attached to them
“a strip of parchment on which was recorded, in handwriting undoubtedly
contemporary, that the two little portraits were ‘fynely’
painted by Lavina Teerlinc in 1590 at Greenwich.”<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c020'><b>[551]</b></a> It is impossible
however, that miniatures painted in 1590 can be her work if Mr.
Weale’s conjecture<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c020'><b>[552]</b></a> that she died before 1580 is correct; but Dr.
Williamson, who has been good enough to re-examine his notes, made
when the miniatures were in the Hawkins collection, is now of opinion
that the date on the parchment is not 1590, but 1570. The third
figure is indistinct, but appears to be 7. If this is so, the attribution
of these charming little works to Livina is very probably a true one,
and the artist may still have predeceased her husband, as Mr. Weale
surmises. There is an interesting miniature in Earl Spencer’s collection,
signed with an “L,” and dated 1526, a double portrait, said
to represent Sir John Boling and his mother, though the couple
appear to be man and wife, which has been ascribed by some writers
to Lucas d’Heere, though the date, of course, makes such authorship
impossible. Mr. J. J. Foster<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c020'><b>[553]</b></a> states that when he examined it he
thought he could discern a “T” following the “L,” and suggests
that it was the work of Livina Teerlinc; but this is equally impossible,
for, according to Mr. Weale’s researches, she and her husband
did not reach England until about 1545, while in 1526 she must have
been a mere child.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MINIATURE OF KRATZER</div>
<p class='c023'>There are several very interesting miniatures in the Pierpont Morgan
Collection which, although they cannot be given to Holbein himself,
are certainly of his school and period. One of the finest represents a
Baseler named Arnold Franz, a man with a brown beard and moustache,
dressed in black.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c020'><b>[554]</b></a> It is in a richly-enamelled gold frame with
pendant pearls, and the sitter’s age, “<span class='fss'>AET. 32</span>,” enamelled on
the front, and on the reverse, “Arnold Franz, Holbein Pinx.” It was
procured at the sale of a collection in Basel, and was stated to have
been in the possession of the descendants of the sitter ever since it
was painted. There was also an unbroken family tradition that Holbein
himself had painted it, and that Franz, said to have been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>printer and a friend of Froben’s, was intimately acquainted with the
artist. The Franz family, now extinct, are also said to have possessed
for many years a letter from Holbein to his friend, in which the miniature
is mentioned, but the document has been lost.<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c020'><b>[555]</b></a> A second miniature
in Mr. Morgan’s collection is a portrait of Niklaus Kratzer, and is
evidently by the same hand as the one of Arnold Franz. It is not a
reduced version of the Louvre picture, which was painted in 1528,
but appears, in Dr. Williamson’s opinion, to have been painted some
years earlier than that date, though, if that be the case, it is not very
likely that Holbein was its author. The face is nearly in profile, to
the left, and the astronomer is wearing the customary fur-lined black
coat and black cap, and a gold chain round his neck. In his hand he
holds a brass armillary sphere. A third miniature, in the same possession,
which has considerable affinity in style to the two just mentioned,
represents Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. It was formerly
in the possession of the royal house of Holland, and afterwards in the
Propert and Tomkinson collections. Dr. Williamson suggests that
some of the Holbeinesque miniatures, such as these, which exist in
considerable numbers, may have been the work of Hans Mielich (1515-1572),
of Munich, who painted portraits and miniatures of some merit,
and was for a time court painter to the Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria.
There is no record, however, of any visit paid by him to England.
Others may be possibly the work of such painters as Thomas and John
Bettes and Guillim Stretes, who are dealt with in a succeeding
chapter.<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c020'><b>[556]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>There remains one other miniature to be noted, which until recently
was regarded as the work of Hans Mielich, but is now, with apparent
justice, given to Holbein. It is in the Bavarian National Museum,
Munich, and represents a young man, turned slightly to the right, with
a fair pointed beard and moustache, and wearing a black dress and
cap. It is inscribed upon the blue background, on either side of the
sitter’s head, “<span class='fss'>H.M. ÆTATIS SVÆ 27</span>.”<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c020'><b>[557]</b></a> It was once thought to be a
portrait of Melanchthon, and afterwards, on account of the initials it
bears, it was regarded as a portrait of Mielich by himself. Its attribution
to Holbein was due to Dr. Hans Buchheit, the director of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>National Museum, who published it in 1911 as a work of the painter’s
later time. The initials upon it are undoubtedly those of the sitter,
and not of the artist, and it has been suggested that it represents the
painter, Harry Maynert, one of the witnesses to Holbein’s will.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c020'><b>[558]</b></a>
Whether this is so or not, the miniature itself is a fine one, and, judging
from a photograph alone, its attribution to Holbein by Dr. Buchheit
must be accepted as the correct one.</p>

IF, through some great misfortune, nothing remained
of Holbein’s work but the wonderful series of drawings
of the heads of the men and women of Henry
VIII’s court, in the royal library at Windsor, this
collection alone would still afford irresistible proof of
his right to the title of one of the very greatest
masters of portraiture. The history of these drawings can be
traced with some exactness, though there are certain breaks in
the continuity of the story. In whatever way they may have
been preserved by Holbein during his lifetime, they were, shortly
after his death, bound together in book form, and so remained
until their rediscovery in the eighteenth century. Although they
are not included in the elaborate inventory of the royal collection
of works of art, dated 24th April 1542, or in the second inventory
taken five years later, in the first year of Edward VI’s reign,
it may be conjectured that they came into the possession of the Crown
on Holbein’s death in 1543, or very shortly afterwards. His death
was so sudden, that they may have been left behind in his painting-room
at Whitehall, unknown to his executors, and so remained in
royal keeping, though this is not a very likely surmise. It is certain,
in any case, that the book containing them was at one time in the
possession of Edward VI. This is proved by an entry in the Lumley
inventory of 1590, to which reference has been already made more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>than once. The entry is as follows: “A greate booke of Pictures
doone by Haunce Holbyn of certeyne Lordes, Ladyes, gentlemen and
gentlewomen in King Henry the 8: his tyme, their names subscribed
by S<b>r</b> John Cheke Secretary to King Edward the 6 w<b>ch</b> book was
King Edward the 6.”</p>

<p class='c023'>There is no reason to doubt the statement that the names on
many of the drawings were supplied by Sir John Cheke, who, at
one time professor of Greek at Cambridge, became one of the tutors of
the young Prince before he ascended the throne, and died in 1557.
He must thus have been intimately acquainted with a certain number
of Holbein’s sitters, though not with all of them. This would account
for the fact that although many of the names he has written on the
drawings are the right ones, certain others are incorrect, while some
fourteen of them are not named at all. He made mistakes, for
instance, over some of the earlier drawings, such as several of the
sitters in the More Family Group, with whom he was not likely to
have been acquainted, and in some doubtful cases he probably indulged
in guesswork. The late Sir Richard Holmes considered that
he merely made a list of the drawings, which has not survived, and
that from this list the names were inscribed on the sheets by some
later hand.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c020'><b>[559]</b></a> There is an entry in the accounts of Sir Thomas Carwarden,
Master of the Revels, preserved among the Loseley MSS.,
which very probably refers to this very book of drawings. The document
is undated, but is considered to be of the reign of Edward VI.
It is as follows: “Item for a peynted booke of Mr. Hanse Holby
making, 6 <i>li.</i>” It is, of course, quite possible that this “peynted
booke” may have had nothing to do with the Windsor drawings, but
there is no other known work of Holbein’s to which the description
would so well apply. The supposition that it was the very book, and
that it was purchased by Sir Thomas for Edward VI, fits in well with
the fact, established by the Lumley inventory, that the youthful
monarch at one time possessed it. If this be so, the suggestion that
Henry VIII obtained it immediately after Holbein’s death is, of course,
incorrect.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF DRAWINGS</div>
<p class='c023'>It would appear that the book came into the possession of Henry
Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, after the death of Edward VI, either by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>gift or purchase, and was preserved at Nonsuch, together with the
various portraits by Holbein, already mentioned, some of which were
certainly at one time in the royal possession; and on his death in
1580, passed to his son-in-law, Lord Lumley. The palace and estate
of Nonsuch reverted to the Crown in 1591, by exchange for other
property, but at what time the numerous pictures by Holbein left the
possession of the Lumley family is not known. At Lord Lumley’s
death in 1609 the greater number of his books passed into the hands
of Henry, Prince of Wales, elder brother of Charles I, and it is very
probable that the “greate booke of Pictures doone by Haunce Holbyn”
accompanied them, and once again formed part of the royal collections.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c020'><b>[560]</b></a>
It is usually stated, however, that Charles I obtained them through
the good offices of M. de Liancourt, the French ambassador, this statement
being based on a note in Abraham Van der Doort’s catalogue of
that monarch’s pictures, which, if correct, indicates that at some time
between the drawing up of the Lumley inventory (1590) and the list
of King Charles’ pictures (1639), the book of drawings had been taken
into France, and so cannot have belonged to Henry, Prince of Wales.
It seems certain, nevertheless, that this supposed journey to France
and back again never took place. Mr. Lionel Cust’s suggestion is
evidently correct, and the mistake has arisen through a confusion
between Holbein’s book of drawings and a very similar book of drawings
by a French hand, representing illustrious personages of the French
court, both of which were in the King’s collection, and are separately
described in Van der Doort’s catalogue. It was the latter book, no
doubt, which was procured through M. de Liancourt, some such
volume as that now at Knowsley, or the collection formerly at Castle
Howard, now at Chantilly,<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c020'><b>[561]</b></a> or the numerous albums of a similar kind
scattered about France. Holbein’s book of drawings, on the other
hand, came to Charles I from his brother.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f560'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r560'>560</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Cust, <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, vol. xviii., February 1911, p. 269.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f561'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r561'>561</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These were purchased by the fifth Earl of Carlisle in
Flanders, probably towards the close of the eighteenth century.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The King, however, did not retain the volume for long, but exchanged
it with the Earl of Pembroke for the beautiful little picture of “St.
George slaying the Dragon,” by Raphael, which is now in the Hermitage
Gallery, St. Petersburg. This latter is entered in Van der Doort’s
catalogue as “A little St. George, which the King had in exchange of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>My Lord Chamberlain, Earl of Pembroke, for the book of Holbein’s
drawings.” This picture was sold by the Commonwealth for £150,
and after passing through the La Noue, De Sourdis, and Crozat collections,
found a final resting-place in the Hermitage. In 1627, while
still in the Earl of Pembroke’s possession, it was engraved by Lucas
Vorsterman, so that the exchange with the King may have taken place
in 1628 or thereabouts. Lord Pembroke, in his turn, did not keep
the drawings, but almost at once passed them on to the great collector,
Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, who, according to Sir Edward
Walker, who wrote his life, had “more of that exquisite master, Hans
Holbein, than are in the world besides.” Whether Lord Pembroke
gave the drawings to him, or in his turn carried out a second exchange,
is not known.</p>

<p class='c023'>Their presence in the Arundel Collection is proved by a contemporary
reference in the manuscript among the Harleian MSS.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c020'><b>[562]</b></a> in the British
Museum entitled, “An exact &amp; Compendious Discours concerning the
Art of Miniatura or Limning,” on the fly-leaf of which is written, in
an eighteenth-century hand, “of Limning by Hilliard,” to which
attention has been already called.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c020'><b>[563]</b></a> As the Holbein drawings were
still in the possession of Charles I in 1627, the paragraph in the
“discours” which speaks of them as in the Arundel Collection cannot
have been penned by Nicholas Hilliard himself, who died in 1619.
The compiler was almost certainly Edward Norgate, who held Holbein
in the highest estimation. Speaking of the painting of shadows, he
says:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>NORGATE’S REFERENCES</div>
<p class='c023'>The reference to the Windsor drawings occurs in the chapter
dealing with crayon-painting. “I shall not need,” the writer says,
“to insist upon the particulars of this manner of working; it shall
suffice, if you please, to view of a book of pictures by the life, by the
incomparable Hans Holbein, servant to King Henry the Eighth.
They are the pictures of most of the English lords and ladies then
living, and were the patterns whereby that excellent painter made
his pictures in oil by; they are all done in this latter manner of
crayons I speak of, and though many of them be miserably spoiled
by the injury of time, and the ignorance of some who formerly have
had the keeping of the book, yet you will find in those ruinous remains
an admirable hand, and a rare manner of working in few lines and no
labour in expressing of the life and likeness, many times equal to his
own, and ever excelling other men’s oil pictures. The book hath been
long a wanderer; but is now happily fallen into the hands of my
noble lord the Earl Marshal.”<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c020'><b>[565]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f565'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r565'>565</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Quoted by Wornum, p. 398. Dallaway, in his notes to
Walpole, vol. i. p. 84, quotes this passage with slight differences,
and adds after “Earl Marshal”—“a most eminent patron to all painters
who understood the arte; and who therefore preserved this book with
his life, till both were lost together”—which is not consistent with
the words preceding it.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>A second contemporary reference to the drawings occurs in
the Bodleian Library manuscript, <i>Miniatura or the Art of Limning,
etc.</i>, also by Edward Norgate, to which reference has been already
made.<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c020'><b>[566]</b></a> Norgate, when dealing with crayon drawings, says: “A
better way was used by Holbein, by priming a large paper with a
carnation or complexion of flesh-colour, whereby he made pictures by
the life, of many great lords and ladies of his time, with black and
red chalke, with other flesh colours, made up hard and dry, like small
pencil sticks. Of this kind was an excellent booke, while it remained
in the hands of the most noble Earl of Arundel and Surrey. But I
heare it has been a great traveller, and wherever now, he hath got
his errata, or (which is as good) hath met with an index expurgatorius,
and is made worse with mending.”<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c020'><b>[567]</b></a> That the book was described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>as a “great traveller” is, no doubt, due to the fact that from 1642
until his death, four years later, the Earl was living on the
Continent, and that he took all his works of art with him. “After
her husband’s death,” says Mr. Cust,<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c020'><b>[568]</b></a> “the Countess of Arundel
continued to reside at various places on the Continent, accompanied
by her collections, until her own death at Amsterdam in 1654. Litigation
then ensued between her sons as to the disposal of her property.
A good part of the valuable Arundel Collection was disposed of in Holland
by the Countess’s younger son, Lord Stafford, but a considerable
part eventually returned to the family of the Duke of Norfolk in
England.” There is every reason to suppose that among the latter
the Holbein book was included.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>LATER HISTORY OF THE DRAWINGS</div>
<p class='c023'>It should be noted that, according to Charles I’s catalogue, the
number of drawings was only fifty-four. Van der Doort may have
made a mistake in the entry, putting a 5 instead of an 8, otherwise it
must be supposed that Lord Arundel already possessed some thirty
of these “heads,” which he added to the book after Lord Pembroke
had given it to him. The collection as it now exists does not contain
the whole of the portrait-drawings of Holbein’s English period. The
fine head of Lord Abergavenny at Wilton appears to have been kept
back, or to have been accidentally retained, by Lord Pembroke when he
parted with the remainder of the collection, and there are several others
in continental museums and elsewhere, some of which are known to
have once formed part of the Arundel Collection. At Basel there are
Sir Nicholas Carew, an unknown English lady, and a second English
lady and her husband; at Dresden the Count Moretta; at Munich
the head of Henry VIII; at Berlin a fine head of an unknown
Englishman; in the Salting Collection the magnificent study of a
lady already described;<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c020'><b>[569]</b></a> and the two heads in the Duke of Devonshire’s
Collection at Chatsworth.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c020'><b>[570]</b></a> If, therefore, Van der Doort is
correct in stating that there were only fifty-four drawings in the
book when it was in his keeping, the one person in England most
likely to have added so considerably to their number was the Earl
of Arundel, who was unceasing in his search for original works from
Holbein’s hand. There is no record to show at what time the book
returned to the royal collections, though the tradition noted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Dallaway, in his edition of Walpole’s <i>Anecdotes</i>, that they were purchased
for James II at the sale of the possessions of Henry, Duke
of Norfolk, in 1686, is no doubt the correct one.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c020'><b>[571]</b></a> A list of the
drawings was included in James II’s catalogue, which was published
by Bathoe in 1758. After this the drawings themselves were laid
aside and forgotten, and it was not until early in the reign of
George II that they were rediscovered by Queen Caroline hidden
away in a folio in an old bureau in Kensington Palace, together with
a volume of equal importance containing the drawings of Leonardo
da Vinci, which now form so valuable a part of the royal collection at
Windsor. Queen Caroline had them framed and glazed, and for many years
they decorated her own apartments, first at Richmond,
and afterwards in Kensington Palace. Early in the succeeding reign
they were removed to the Queen’s House, now Buckingham Palace,
where they were taken from the frames and bound up in two volumes,
forming a part of the large collection of drawings, similarly bound,
got together by George III. The suggestion that they should be engraved
originated with Dalton, the keeper of the King’s drawings,
but the work was so badly done that it was abandoned in 1774 after
ten plates only had been issued. The engraver was George Vertue,
who, according to Walpole, was the originator of the project. “It
is a great pity,” he says, “that they have not been engraved; not
only that such frail performances of so great a genius might be preserved,
but that the resemblances of so many illustrious persons,
nowhere else existing, might be saved from destruction. Vertue had
undertaken this noble work; and after spending part of three years
on it, broke off, I do not know why, after having traced off, on oil
paper, but about five and thirty. These I bought at his sale; and
they are so exactly taken as to be little inferior to the originals.”<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c020'><b>[572]</b></a>
This tracing was done by Vertue and Müntz when the drawings were
hanging in Queen Caroline’s room at Kensington. There were thirty-four
of them, and they were framed and hung in what Walpole called
his Holbein Chamber at Strawberry Hill. Somewhat later the projected
publication was taken up again more successfully, on the suggestion,
according to Dallaway, of Horace Walpole, under the direction of
John Chamberlaine, who succeeded Dalton as keeper of the drawings.
The engravings were published between 1792 and 1800 in fourteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>numbers, containing eighty-two portraits, forming two large folio
volumes, under the title of <i>Imitations of Original Drawings by Hans
Holbein, in the Collection of His Majesty, for the Portraits of Illustrious
Persons of the Court of Henry VIII, with Biographical Tracts</i>. The
historical notices were written by Edmund Lodge, Lancaster Herald,
and the plates, with the exception of eight, were engraved by F. Bartolozzi,
R.A. F. C. Lewis was also engaged to take part in the work,
but his plate of “Cecilia Heron” was in all ways so much finer than
Bartolozzi’s efforts that Chamberlaine had the plate destroyed,
fearing that if it were published side by side with the others, the latter
would suffer so severely from the contrast that the success of the publication
would be endangered. As transcripts of Holbein’s drawings,
Bartolozzi’s engravings have very little artistic merit. Many of them,
indeed, have small likeness to the originals, and all of them lack the
strength and character and the searching truth of line which make
the drawings themselves such masterpieces of art. In more recent
years the drawings have been frequently photographed and published,
the most important series being that issued by Mr. F. Hanfstaengl in
two volumes, with an introduction and descriptive notes by the late Sir
Richard Holmes, F.S.A. It should be added that under Queen Victoria
the two volumes were broken up, and the drawings properly mounted
and arranged. They are now kept in four portfolios.</p>

good, careful copy of the other, in which the hair of the beard is
drawn with great elaboration, from the hand of some follower or
imitator of Holbein, and in one or two other cases the drawings are,
perhaps, only copies of lost originals, or even original drawings by
some other hand, such as the so-called “Melanchthon,” with its
faltering line, which lacks much of Holbein’s customary strength and
certitude.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE METHOD OF THEIR EXECUTION</div>
<p class='c023'>The drawings were executed in almost all cases in black and coloured
chalks. During his first visit to England Holbein used, as a rule,
white paper, the outlines being drawn in black and the features modelled
in red chalk. The series of heads of members of Sir Thomas More’s
family, and contemporary drawings such as the Warham and Guldeford,
are done in this manner. Later on it was his custom to use a paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>covered entirely with a ground of flesh or salmon colour, upon which
the features were modelled in black chalk, and slight touches of red,
after which the outlines were strengthened and the details of the hair,
dress, and ornaments put in with pen or brush and Indian-ink. In
some cases the whole face was completely modelled with the greatest
delicacy, and as a rule the eyes, hair, and beard were drawn in with
water-colour or coloured crayons in their natural hues. Upon a
number of the drawings the colour and material of the costume worn
by the sitter are indicated by notes in Holbein’s own handwriting,
and in some of them details of the ornaments or embroideries have
been drawn on the margin of the sheet with the brush with the sure
and rapid hand of a master. In one instance—the portrait of John
Godsalve—the drawing is entirely finished in water-colours, and the
figure is shown against a blue background; and in one of the two heads
of Sir Thomas More the holes with which it was pricked for tracing
on the panel can still be seen. The earlier drawings are usually the
largest, the one last-named being about 16 in. high by 12 in. wide.
The Warham is 17 in. by 12 in., the Guldeford 15 in. by 11 in., and the
Godsalve the same size. One of the largest of all is the Jane Seymour,
which is 20½ in. by 11 in.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE METHOD OF THEIR EXECUTION</div>
<p class='c023'>“Some have been rubbed,” says Walpole, “and others traced
over with a pen on the outlines by some unskilful hand.”<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c020'><b>[573]</b></a> In a
few instances, it is true, these strengthening touches appear to be by
some other hand than Holbein’s, but in most of the drawings they are
just as certainly his. The studies have suffered considerable damage
during the passage of time. They are stained, and many of them
badly rubbed, so that the more delicate modelling and colouring
carried out in crayons has almost vanished. In consequence the
brush-work, which has better withstood rough usage, at first sight
appears to be a little hard, and in some instances even coarse, thus
slightly marring that perfect harmony of effect which characterised
the drawings when fresh from the artist’s hand. The finer details
have been worn away, leaving certain lines more prominent than Holbein
intended. A closer study, however, as Sir Richard Holmes points
out, shows that it is to the wonderful strength and delicacy combined
of these touches that the portraits owe the vivid and life-like quality
which they so pre-eminently possess. “On some of the heads these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>touches occur only on the eyes, nostrils, and lips, where the marvellous
accuracy of modelling, particularly in the corners of the mouth, is not
to be excelled in the work of any other master.”<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c020'><b>[574]</b></a> It must be remembered,
too, that these studies were, in almost all cases, working
drawings, done for transference or for copying on the panel, and are
in that sense not finished works, some parts and details being emphasised
more strongly than others. In certain of the drawings the beard
and the hair have been put in with the brush with that careful and
elaborate detail with which such features were usually carried out by
Holbein in his finished portraits; for instance, in the long beard of
Sir Thomas Wyat or the close-cut hair of Simon George. In other
drawings the unshaven stubble on a man’s chin or upper lip is put
in with a few masterly strokes. Here and there high lights have
been indicated with a touch of white, as in the heads of Lord and Lady
Vaux. It may be taken, then, that in the greater number of cases,
the only hand which can be traced in these drawings is that of Holbein
himself, dimmed here and there by the passing of the years, or rough
or careless usage at some time or other during their earlier wanderings.
Certain critics, however, consider that in many of them, some later
hand has attempted to revivify the fading lines, with results quite
contrary to those intended. Mr. Campbell Dodgson, speaking of
the lovely head of an Englishwoman in the Salting Collection, describes
it as being “entirely free from the retouching which disfigures
many of the Windsor heads.”<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c020'><b>[575]</b></a> Mr. Gerald Davies is also among
those who consider that the drawings have been retouched by some
other hand than Holbein’s. “I am quite persuaded,” he says, “that
the strengthening of the outlines, either by chalk lines or in many cases
by Indian-ink, is not due to the hand of Holbein himself. Among the
drawings are a few which have never been so touched. The lines of
these are of great delicacy and of the most expressive quality—an
artistic dream which has almost faded from the paper. These are
the select few which, having suffered most from rubbing, and having
the faintest indications to guide the hand of the reinforcer, have been
left in their ghostly beauty. Others have been revived by the application
of a bolder chalk line of the proper colour in parts where the
outline seemed most to need it. It has been done on the whole well, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>such a thing can ever be said to have been well done at all. But these
same lines will be found to be hard and wiry, and somewhat unfeeling
as compared to the subtly sympathetic outline of the master himself.
There remains yet the further manner of reinforcement by a strong
outlining, often accompanied by a slight thickening in parts by means
of a wash, in what appears to be Indian-ink. The ink has toned
now, and has lost much of the offence of its once strong contrast with
the rest of the delicate modelling. But remembering what that contrast
would have been when the ink was fresh, I find it impossible to
believe that it was added by the hand of Holbein.”<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c020'><b>[576]</b></a> Mr. Davies
suggests that this Indian-ink strengthening took place when the drawings
came into the hands of Charles I, and that possibly Wenceslaus
Hollar was employed for the purpose. It is difficult to follow him in
this suggestion of Hollar’s retouching, nor can the writer agree with
him in his opinion that a more or less wholesale retouching of the drawings
has ever been undertaken by any hand than that of Holbein
himself. A more credible suggestion is that of Mr. Lionel Cust, who
says: “It is very probable that the drawings were refreshed by outlines
very soon after Holbein’s death, if not by the painter himself.
Since that date the most likely time for them to have suffered any
alteration would have been after their rediscovery at Kensington,
when they were for a time in the hands of George Vertue, an expert
crayon-artist himself as well as engraver.”<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c020'><b>[577]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Some part of the damage done to them may have been due to wear
and tear in the artist’s own studio, for it is possible that he employed
an assistant or two; though if that had been the case, it is strange that
there is no record among the State papers of a licence granting him
leave to employ journeymen, such as was necessary under the Act
dealing with foreign residents. It is possible, too, though far from
probable, that he may have had one or two pupils—though here again
there is no record of them—who would copy his drawings, and might
be entrusted occasionally with the tracing of the drawings upon the
panel, or even in painting parts of the replicas of portraits which must
sometimes have been ordered. It is evident that these drawings
were made solely for the artist’s own purposes, both in order to avoid
a too frequent attendance of his sitters at his studio, and also because
it was the method of working which best suited him. They remained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>therefore, in his own possession, and were never handed over to his
patrons. The fashion of collecting portraits of celebrities which was
in vogue in France throughout the sixteenth century was only imitated
in a very minor degree in England. In France, as M. Dimier points
out, “the result of this rage for portraits was that people were not
content with the necessarily limited number of originals. The works of
the masters of the time were copied and recopied a hundred times,
often by unskilful and sometimes by absolutely clumsy hands. This
was the case not only with the portraits of kings and queens, which
have been multiplied thus in all ages, but with those of any one at
court—a feature which is peculiar to the period under consideration.
Not even the number of painted portraits and painted copies was
enough; there was a demand for quicker and cheaper satisfaction.
The original chalk-drawings were copied, in the same medium, an
infinite number of times, far oftener, indeed, than the paintings;
and these drawings were commonly bound into albums and preserved
as family treasures. A vast number of these albums must have
perished, but a vast number still exist.”<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c020'><b>[578]</b></a> Nothing of this kind
occurred on this side of the Channel. Holbein’s original drawings,
after his death, were preserved in a volume in this fashion, but they
formed an unique example. Though copies or duplicates of one or
two of them exist, such as the John Fisher and the Duchess of Suffolk
in the British Museum, the Guldeford, Fisher and Poyntz formerly in
the Heseltine Collection, and the head called Sir Charles Wingfield in
the collection of Sir John Leslie, Bart., recently published by Mr.
Lionel Cust,<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c020'><b>[579]</b></a> the collection as a whole was never copied in this way,
as it would have been in France. It is doubtful if most of these duplicates,
fine as they are, are actually from Holbein’s own hand.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>STUDIES FOR LOST PORTRAITS</div>
<p class='c023'>It may be taken for granted that portraits were painted from
nearly all these Windsor studies, more than eighty in number, though
possibly a few, drawn during the last months of his life, were not carried
out in this way. It is, therefore, a little extraordinary that less than
thirty of such finished oil portraits have so far been traced, the remainder
having disappeared; and of these latter only about one half
are original paintings by Holbein, the remainder being copies of lost
originals. Among the first-named we have Jane Seymour, Catherine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Howard, the Prince of Wales, Sir Thomas More, Warham, Guldeford,
Southwell, John Godsalve, Reskimer, Simon George, Lady Vaux,
Lady Rich, Lady Butts, Lady Audley (miniature only), and one or
two others; in the second class the More Family Group is the most
important, there being no less than seven studies for this great work
at Windsor, including the one of Sir Thomas himself.</p>

<p class='c023'>There still remain more than fifty drawings in England alone of
which no paintings are known. It seems impossible that the whole
of these pictures should have perished. Some of them, it is to be
hoped, may yet be discovered, hidden away in some remote country
house, perhaps obscured by dirt and disfigured by repaintings, so
that hitherto they have remained unrecognised. It is not very likely
that drawings of this size were made as preliminary studies for miniatures,
or otherwise this might account for some of the missing portraits,
as such small works would be much more easily lost than panel paintings.
It is true that in a few instances, such as the portraits of Lady
Audley and the Earl of Abergavenny, we have miniatures closely following
the drawings, but no large portraits; but it does not follow
that the latter were not painted.</p>

<p class='c023'>On the other hand, there are a considerable number of Holbein’s
portraits—between thirty and forty—for which no preliminary studies
remain, and these range over every period of his career. This, however,
is not so extraordinary, for drawings disappear more easily than
pictures. In some instances, too, their absence may be explained
by the artist’s method of work. It was his occasional habit, more
particularly in the earlier half of his career, to fasten down the preliminary
study upon the panel, and use it as the ground-work of his
painting, so that the drawing naturally was lost. The portrait of his
wife and children at Basel has been carried out in this way, and the
Anne of Cleves in the Louvre is painted on vellum or parchment,
afterwards mounted on canvas. This, however, was not his more
regular practice, which was to transfer the study to the panel by tracing
or pricking. Not a single study exists for any one of the portraits
of the German merchants of the Steelyard, or for such portraits as the
Duchess of Milan, Jean de Dinteville and the Bishop of Lavaur,
Kratzer, Thomas Godsalve, Sir Henry Wyat, Cromwell, Tuke, the Duke
of Norfolk, Cheseman, Dr. Chamber, and the painted portraits of
various unknown men at Berlin, Vienna, Basel, and elsewhere. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the portraits of Erasmus there is only a study for the hands, while
there is no drawing for the Amerbach or Froben. On the other hand,
among a number of fine drawings in continental museums there are,
in addition to the two earlier and three later ones of the members of
the Meyer family, only two—the Morette in Dresden and the Sir
Nicholas Carew in Basel—of which the finished paintings still exist.</p>

<p class='c023'>There is no doubt that Holbein’s practice as a portrait painter
during his second and longer residence in England was almost entirely
confined to the court and to those who were in the King’s employment.
The Windsor drawings, a number of which have been described in previous
chapters of this book, make this sufficiently clear. Included
among the heads which have not been described are John Russell,
Earl of Bedford; Sir William Parr, afterwards Marquis of Northampton;
Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde; Edward
Stanley, Earl of Derby; George Brooke, Lord Cobham; Thomas,
Lord Vaux; Sir Thomas Parry; Sir William Sherrington; Sir Thomas
Wentworth; Edward, Lord Clinton; Sir Thomas le Strange; Sir
George Carew; Lord Chancellor Rich, and others; and among
the ladies, Lady Parker, Lady Ratcliffe, Mary Zouch, Lady Rich,
Lady Henegham, the Marchioness of Dorset, Lady Mewtas, Lady
Monteagle, and Lady Borough.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME OF THE HEADS</div>
<p class='c023'>The study of William Parr, Marquis of Northampton (<a href='#pl-34b'>Pl. 34 (2)</a>),<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c020'><b>[580]</b></a>
is one of the few in which the hands are shown. The head, with close-cropped
hair and short, round beard, has suffered from rubbing, but
remains a fine and strongly individualised study of character. The
dress and jewellery are indicated with some elaboration, to which are
added notes in Holbein’s handwriting, and detailed sketches of his hat
ornaments and other jewellery are drawn in the margin. The medallion
he wears appears to be of open-work with a figure of St. George, and
one of the links of his chain is inscribed with the word “<span class='sc'>Mors</span>.” In
the Thomas Boleyn,<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c020'><b>[581]</b></a> also, the right hand is shown, and the dress is
drawn with much more detail than in most of the companion drawings,
while the face is one of the most carefully elaborated in the whole
series, the individual hairs of the beard and moustache being indicated
with minute precision. Equally careful drawing of the hair is to be
seen in the head of Lord Stanley,<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c020'><b>[582]</b></a> with its expressive face and fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>eyes. Another very powerful drawing is the full-face portrait of Lord
Cobham,<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c020'><b>[583]</b></a> with open doublet showing his bare chest, a head of most
striking individuality. One of the most beautiful among the more
finished studies is that of Lord Vaux (<a href='#pl-35'>Pl. 35</a>),<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c020'><b>[584]</b></a> in which the hair,
cut straight across the forehead, and the beard and moustache are put
in with almost microscopic detail, as well as the design upon the white
collar with its strings of black and white cord. There is a second study
of Lord Vaux<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c020'><b>[585]</b></a> in the collection. It is, of course, impossible to give
even a short description of the whole of the drawings, but among the
numerous studies of “unknown men” two in particular cannot be
overlooked. The one is the head of a handsome young man with a
long, sharp nose,<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c020'><b>[586]</b></a> thin whiskers, and a small beard, the head turned
slightly to the right, and both eyes shown (<a href='#pl-34a'>Pl. 34 (1)</a>). He wears large
ostrich feathers in his black hat, which has a medallion, the design
not indicated, and gold tags. The dress, very roughly sketched in,
is badly rubbed. The drawing is one of great beauty, very delicate
and refined in its treatment and feeling. The second, to which reference
has been already made, is the very striking likeness of a man
with a flat, broad nose, bushy, curly beard, and hair falling over the
ears, his eyes cast slightly downwards, one of the most powerful
drawings in the Windsor Collection, which Miss Hervey suggests is
possibly a study for a second portrait of Jean de Dinteville (<a href='#pl-36a'>Pl. 36# (1)</a>).<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c020'><b>[587]</b></a>
Dr. Paul Ganz considers the sitter to be a man of pronounced southern
French type, and probably a member of the French embassy which
was in London in 1533.<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c020'><b>[588]</b></a> It is just as probable, however, that this
unknown nobleman was English, for the type, though unusual, is to
be met with occasionally.</p>

<p class='c023'>Among the portraits of ladies it is unfortunate that several of the

with a figure subject now almost obliterated, and across the top of
the bodice a band of pearls set in groups of five like flowers. The
incorrectly-named “Lady Mary, after Queen,”<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c020'><b>[591]</b></a> whom it certainly does
not represent, is another fine drawing which has suffered considerable
damage. It has been gone over with the tracing point for transference
to panel, but no painting after it is now known to exist. The
same is the case with the head of the Marchioness of Dorset,<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c020'><b>[592]</b></a> the
daughter of Charles Brandon and the King’s sister, Mary, which also
shows indications of tracing. This is a good example of a drawing in
which the fine modelling of the face has now almost disappeared, so
that the darker lines stand out too insistently. There is most brilliant
and subtle drawing of the eyes, nose, and mouth in the very expressive
and beautiful head of the so-called Lady Henegham (<a href='#pl-38'>Pl. 38</a>),<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c020'><b>[593]</b></a> wife
of Sir Anthony Hemingham or Heveningham, of Ketteringham in
Norfolk, which remains in very excellent condition. She wears a small
pendant ornament with one hanging pearl at her neck, and on the
breast an upright oval medallion with a figure within a Renaissance
framework. It has been suggested that this fine head really represents
Margaret Roper, and the features are not unlike those of several
members of the More family; but against this attribution must be
placed the fact that the drawing, unlike all the other studies for the
family picture, is not on white paper. Among the best of the other
heads of women are Lady Parker,<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c020'><b>[594]</b></a> Lady Lister,<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c020'><b>[595]</b></a> Lady Rich,<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c020'><b>[596]</b></a> Lady
Elyot,<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c020'><b>[597]</b></a> Lady Audley, already described (<a href='#pl-37a'>Pl. 37 (1)</a>), an unknown
lady, wearing a white cap or bonnet covering the hair and ears and
reaching to the chin<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c020'><b>[598]</b></a>—a large drawing on white paper, something of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the type of the More family, but rather more freely drawn—and Mary
Zouch (<a href='#pl-36b'>Pl. 36 (2)</a>).<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c020'><b>[599]</b></a> The last-named is one of the most attractive of the
whole series. The face, seen in full, is modelled with extreme delicacy
and expression. She wears a French circular hood with bands of ornament
over her smooth, yellow hair, parted in the middle and covering
the ears. Her dress is of black velvet, as noted in Holbein’s handwriting,
and the medallion at her breast, surrounded with a Renaissance
framework, has an almost obliterated subject, apparently a
female figure with flying draperies seated on a rock, possibly Perseus
and Andromeda. This drawing is inscribed “M. Souch,” and Sir
Richard Holmes, following Wornum, suggests that the drawing
represents Joan, wife of Richard Zouch, son of Lord Zouch of Haringworth.
It is, however, more probably Mary Zouch, a member of the
same family, who was a maid of honour to Jane Seymour, and, after
the Queen’s death, received an annuity of £10 on April 6th, 1542, in
recognition of her services, which was to be continued until she “was
married or otherwise provided for.”<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c020'><b>[600]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>STUDIES IN BERLIN AND BASEL</div>
<p class='c023'>The Berlin Print Room possesses a remarkably fine portrait-drawing
of an unknown Englishman,<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c020'><b>[601]</b></a> with deep blue eyes, straight brown
hair, a scanty beard, and a thoughtful, expressive face, slightly turned
to the left. He wears a small flat cap, unornamented, and the usual
gown with heavy fur collar. Only slight touches of colour have been
used on the eyes, hair, and lips, and the paper has been covered with
a pale red wash.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Among the portrait-drawings in the Basel Gallery, some fourteen
in all, most of which have been already described, the finest is perhaps
that of an unknown young man in a large, broad-brimmed black hat,<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c020'><b>[602]</b></a>
which is certainly one of the most beautiful of his drawings now
existing (<a href='#pl-39'>Pl. 39</a>). The sitter, a handsome and dignified man, with a
large, straight nose, and refined features—evidently a man of culture
of the type of Bonifacius Amerbach—is turned to the left, the face seen
almost in profile, though both eyes are shown. The lips of the mobile
mouth are slightly parted, and the expressive eyes gaze into the distance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>as though he were lost in thought. The brown, bushy hair, which
covers the ears and falls over the forehead, is drawn with rapid, masterly
touches, and the profile of the face stands out with great effect
against the dark background formed by the underside of his large hat.
The flesh tints are suggested with simple but subtle touches of the
chalk. The dress is merely sketched in with a few lines, though the
brown fur collar of his coat is sufficiently indicated just where it comes
under the beardless chin. This superb drawing, in which the artist
has seized upon and set down with unerring insight the finest traits of
the sitter’s character, is in black and coloured chalks. The type
of face, in the opinion of Woltmann and Dr. Ganz, is distinctly
German. From its technique, which, on the one hand, has much in
common with the later studies of the Meyer family made for the Darmstadt
“Madonna,” and on the other with the drawings for the More
Family Group, it may be surmised that this study was made in Basel
shortly before Holbein left for his first visit to England. It has much
in common, too, with the coloured drawing in Basel of Holbein himself,
and it may be noted, as a small point, that the hat the unknown youth
is wearing is similar to the one the artist wears, though rather larger,
and is of a different fashion from the black head-gear worn by Holbein’s
English sitters.</p>

<p class='c023'>Among the other portraits of unknown personages at Basel are
two heads of an Englishman and his wife,<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c020'><b>[603]</b></a> and a third, still finer, of
a lady wearing the angular English head-dress and black fall, who was
evidently a member of the court circle.<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c020'><b>[604]</b></a> This drawing, which is also in
black and coloured chalks, must be placed among the best of Holbein’s
studies of women. It has been conjectured that it represents Lady
Carew, and also Lady Guldeford. The equally beautiful drawing of Sir
Nicholas Carew<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c020'><b>[605]</b></a> has been described already. All the drawings just
mentioned form part of the Amerbach Collection, and it may be suggested,
though the suggestion is not a very plausible one, that at least
those of them which represent English people were taken to Basel by
Holbein himself, on one or other of his visits home, and were left
behind when he returned to England, together with the sketch-book,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>also in the Amerbach Collection, which is undoubtedly of the English
period; or, on the other hand, they may have been sent over from
London to his widow with his personal belongings by his executors
after his death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN AND THE CLOUETS</div>
<p class='c023'>Altogether apart from their artistic merits, these drawings of
Holbein’s are of the utmost historical value, both on account of their
number, including as they do so many of the leading characters who
played a part in the making of England in Tudor days, and also because
of the perfection of their draughtsmanship and the corresponding
life-likeness of their portraiture, so that they form true documents
in every sense of the word. Holbein’s genius shows us Henry’s
ministers and the lords and ladies who surrounded him, just as they
were in life, without any attempt at flattery, but with every feature
set down with unfaltering truth, and, above all, with a grasp of character
which the portrait drawings of no other great master of his period
show in the same degree. He has left behind, as a mine of wealth for
the use of the student of history, in drawings alone, without taking
into account his numerous painted portraits for which no drawings
now exist, a series of more than one hundred representations of Tudor
men and women. In only one other instance can we turn to a similar
series of contemporary portraits—the chalk drawings of French men
and women of the same century by the two Clouets, Jean and François,
father and son. These, though of the utmost value as historical portraiture,
and also of great beauty and even fascination as works of
art, fall short of the greatness which stamps Holbein’s work of a like
nature. The elder Clouet had not his mastery of drawing; his knowledge
was more limited and his means more restricted. His drawings
have “a stiffness and dryness which are very far from the flowing
and supple handling of the Basle master.”<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c020'><b>[606]</b></a> His son had considerably
more science. “His drawing in reality is extremely profound, and
as exactly calculated as any known. In tracing the human face and
all the parts presented by the model, he has the ability of a specialist,
whose long practice of an art that is deep rather than wide has enabled
him to accumulate a mass of information and experience. He reaches
perfection in the proportion of the features, in the exact placing of all
the fine fugitive, mobile parts of the face, in the careful study of the
extremely subtle relations from which the mass of form draws its solidity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>and in skill in constructing the unity of impression of a face and of a
type.”<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c020'><b>[607]</b></a> He has little or nothing, however, of Holbein’s beauty of
style. Holbein’s drawings are matchless in the delicacy of their modelling,
every little depression or prominence in the contours of the face
being indicated with an exactitude and a simplicity of means unrivalled
in work of such nature; and also for the way in which this
delicacy of touch in handling the crayon, and subtlety and precision
of the strengthening lines with brush or pencil, are combined with the
wonderful vigour and sense of life with which each individual drawing
is filled. Added to their truthfulness in portraiture there is that
remarkable insight into the true nature and feelings of the sitter
which is one of the greatest qualities of Holbein’s art. It is owing to
the knowledge and mastery which are the basis of these Portrait-Studies—studies
usually made with rapidity, but in which nothing essential
has been missed by the penetrating eye and unerring hand of the artist—that
so perfect a result is obtained with means apparently so slight.
Delicacy and strength meet in them in exquisite combination; the
flexibility and refinement of his line are always kept well under control,
and there is no over-elaboration of detail to the detriment of character.
Each drawing bears upon it the stamp of a style, and of a great
style, which was Holbein’s own individual possession, in which freedom
and truth are tempered and perfected by self-restraint.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>“THE QUEEN OF SHEBA”</div>
<p class='c023'>To attempt even a list of Holbein’s more important drawings
other than his portrait-studies would be quite beyond the scope of
this book, in the course of which, however, many of them have been
touched upon; but there still remain several which cannot be passed
over in silence. Chief among them is the small drawing on parchment,
highly finished like a miniature, in the Library, Windsor Castle, which
represents the “Queen of Sheba’s visit to King Solomon” (<a href='#pl-40'>Pl. 40</a>).<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c020'><b>[608]</b></a>
It is a composition containing no less than thirty-four small figures,
and so, after the wall-paintings in the Basel Town Hall and the
“Triumphs” of the London Steelyard, is one of the most considerable
arrangements of grouping ever attempted by him. King Solomon
is seated on a throne on a high daïs approached by a number of steps
within a large chamber, the roof of which is supported by slender columns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of Renaissance architecture. Behind the throne is suspended a large
curtain, and on the steps on either side are placed groups of the elders
and long-bearded wise men of Solomon’s kingdom. In the centre
the Queen mounts the steps, her hands outstretched as though in wonder
and admiration of the great king. In the foreground a procession of
her ten ladies, walking two and two, passes towards the left, and on
the right are a group of her attendants bearing rich presents, some
of them kneeling with uplifted baskets. The drawing is in silver-point,
slightly washed with grey and brown, and touched here and there
with water-colour; the fruits in one of the baskets are red and green,
and some of the draperies and details are touched with dead gold. The
background between the pillars is blue powdered with gold stars.
The Renaissance architecture of the setting is purer and less florid
in style than is the case with many of Holbein’s earlier studies for glass
paintings. The figures of the women are gracefully conceived and
grouped, and the heads of the men have character and expression. In
its general arrangement the upper half of this miniature drawing recalls
the “Rehoboam” wall-painting in the Basel Town Hall, though the
setting is more richly treated; while in the general gracefulness of
its design it is Italian in feeling, and has close affinity to the “Triumph
of Riches” drawing for the decoration of the Steelyard. It was
probably done at about the same date as the latter, perhaps as a
present for the King, the subject having been chosen as conveying
a subtle and flattering suggestion that Henry and Solomon were alike
in their possession of great wisdom. It is finished with such minute
care that it does not seem likely that it is merely the preparatory
sketch for some larger picture or wall-painting. There is no record
of any wall-decoration of this subject, either in the Steelyard or at
Whitehall, though Holbein may have had some idea when at work
upon it that it might serve for such a purpose afterwards if it met
with the King’s approval; or, on the other hand, it may be a miniature
copy from one of his frescoes in grisaille, which has disappeared,
made by Holbein himself as a gift for his royal master. It was at one
time in the Arundel Collection, and while there was engraved by Hollar.
In the inventory of that collection it is entered as “Regina de Saba
in miniatura chiaroscuro.” There is a picture in the Dresden Gallery
representing the “Death of Virginia,” which appears to be an early
copy of another of Holbein’s lost frescoes in grisaille, which has many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>points in common with the “Queen of Sheba” miniature painting,
and is carried out in a similar scheme of colouring. Both were, no
doubt, the work of his second English residence.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c020'><b>[609]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Another important drawing, of an earlier date, in the Städel
Institut at Frankfurt, represents a transport ship about to put out to
sea.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c020'><b>[610]</b></a> It is a three-masted vessel, with high poop, crowded with small
figures, among them a troop of landsknechte, one of whom stands in
the stern, a fine figure, holding aloft a banner which flaps in the wind.
Others play drum and trumpets, some hold pikes, and one of them
embraces a girl. The anchor has been hauled up, and most of the
sailors are at work in the rigging unfurling the sails; but several of
them are taking parting drinks from large jars, even at the masthead,
and one of the number is already overcome with sea-sickness. Below,
on the left, a boat with two rowers is pulling vigorously towards the
ship, either to put on board a late comer or to fetch off those for the
shore. The exact date of this drawing is uncertain. It is possible
that Holbein saw some such vessel during his visit to Amerbach in
the south of France, or that he made it a year or two later at Antwerp
on his way to England for the first time.</p>

<p class='c023'>His skill in the representation of animals is shown in a number
of drawings. There are some fine horses in the “Triumph of Riches”
study, and also in the “Samuel and Saul” and the “Sapor and
Valerian” drawings for the Basel Town Hall paintings, as well as in
the woodcut of “The Ploughman” in the “Dance of Death” series
and in others of his woodcut illustrations; the latter also showing good
studies of sheep, dogs, and other animals. The early drawings of a
lamb and a bat have been described on a previous page.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c020'><b>[611]</b></a></p>

Holbein was a master in all crafts, and Erasmus’ description

show him to have been a real master of arts in every sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c023'>“The artistic quality he possessed in the highest degree,” says Mr.
M. Digby Wyatt, “was, I consider, the intensity with which he realised
‘form.’ Able master as he was of delineation, what gives the stamp
of enduring truth to his work is the feeling of assurance his delineation
conveys to the mind of the spectator, that what he has drawn from life
was the <i>vera effigies</i> of what he saw—that what he designed could
never be executed with equal propriety in any other way than as his
drawing defined it. There is never any uncertainty as to his intention
or meaning—what he says was, was—what he says should be,
should be. In this precise conception of pure form and power of
conveying his own sense of it to others, he stood upon the same platform
as the great men to whose universal genius I have already alluded—Albert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci. The artist who possesses
in a high degree any such power as that I have attempted to define,
must of necessity have the requisite aptitude for success in either
painting, architecture, or sculpture, or all three; since the power in
question lies at the root of and is indispensable to the satisfactory
practice of either or all. Architects will do well to look earnestly at
such reliques as time has spared of the genius of Dürer, Da Vinci,
and especially of Hans Holbein, since, so far as I know, they were the
best makers of working drawings who ever lived. Of whatever they
drew they gave every characteristic, and their slightest sketches never
fail to mark essentials and to omit secondaries of form and expression.”<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c020'><b>[613]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Horace Walpole, speaking of the rise of Renaissance architecture
in England—“Grecian art plaistered on Gothic,” he calls it—says that
“the beginning of reformation in building seems owing to Holbein. His
porch at Wilton, though purer than the works of his successors, is of this
bastard sort; but the ornaments and proportions are graceful and well
chosen. I have seen drawings of his, too, in the same kind. Where
he acquired this taste is difficult to say; probably it was adopted
from his acquaintance with his fellow-labourers at court.”<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c020'><b>[614]</b></a> Though
there is no doubt that Holbein would have been a fine architect had
his inclination led him to practise that branch of art—the backgrounds
of his designs for painted glass afford ample proof of his aptitude for
design in the new architectural manner of the Italian Renaissance—Walpole’s
assertion cannot be accepted as the truth. Henry VIII
had at least two good Italian architects in his employment—first,
Girolamo da Treviso, and afterwards John of Padua, as well as sculptors
and modellers of architectural detail such as Benedetto da Rovezzano
and Giovanni da Maiano, and it is the influence of such Italians as
these that is to be most clearly discerned in the buildings which were
erected in England at this period. Holbein produced a few designs
of an architectural nature, but no building exists of which it can be
said that he was the architect.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“HOLBEIN’S GATE” AT WHITEHALL</div>
<p class='c023'>The gateway which, according to tradition, he designed, and hence
known as “Holbein’s Gate,” was one of Henry VIII’s additions to
Whitehall, and connected the tennis court, the cock-pit, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>bowling-green with the palace, besides providing the King with a
gallery into the park, from which he could witness the sports which
took place there on special occasions. It was built, according to Walcott,
of stone mixed with small squares of flint, and tesselated, and
was “very neatly set.” J. T. Smith, in his <i>Antiquities of Westminster</i>,
describes it as being in the Tudor style of architecture, with battlements
and four lofty towers, the whole enriched with <i>bustos</i> on the north
and south sides. Pennant, who had himself seen the gate, says:
“To Holbein was owing the most beautiful gate at Whitehall, built
with bricks of two colours, glazed and disposed in a tesselated fashion.
The top, as well as an elegant tower on each side, were embattled.
On each front were four busts, in baked clay, which resisted to the last
every attack of the weather.” An excellent idea of its appearance
is to be obtained from the engraving by G. Vertue (1725) in the
“Vetusta Monumenta.”</p>

<p class='c023'>The gateway was pulled down in 1759 in order to widen Parliament
Street. The materials were obtained by the Duke of Cumberland,
Ranger of Windsor Park, with the intention of re-erecting the gate at
the end of the Long Walk. In the end, however, they were worked up
in several buildings the Duke built in the park. Two of the medallions
were put in front of the park lodges, but most of them appear to have
been stolen when the gateway was pulled down. Three of them
eventually came into the possession of a coachbuilder named Wright,
who, in 1769, employed John Flaxman, the sculptor, then a boy, to
repair them. They were in terra-cotta, coloured and gilt, and the
ornaments included the rose and crown and the King’s initials.
Wright had them removed to Hatfield Priory, Essex, where they
were still to be seen in 1803, in which year J. T. Smith went down there
to copy them. They were larger than life, and were said to be representations
of Henry VII, Henry VIII when sixteen, and Bishop
Fisher. The two which decorated the front of the park lodges were
afterwards removed to Hampton Court, where, says Allan Cunningham,
“they are made to do duty as two of the Roman emperors described
by Hentzner in his <i>Travels</i>.” It seems probable that they were the work
of Giovanni da Maiano. In its design there is nothing to suggest that
Holbein was the architect of this famous gateway, and it is much more
probable that one of the Italians employed by the King was responsible
for it; and the legend which connects Holbein with it may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>arisen from the fact that he had rooms in Whitehall, possibly in the
very gateway to which his name has been so long attached. It contained,
says Dallaway, “several apartments, but the most remarkable
was the ‘little study, called the New Library,’ in which Holbein was
accustomed to employ himself in his art, and the courtiers to sit for
their portraits.”<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c020'><b>[615]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE PORCH AT WILTON</div>
<p class='c023'>Tradition has also long associated the name of Holbein with the Porch
at Wilton, the seat of the Earl of Pembroke. This porch or loggia is
of no great beauty, but it is free from any admixture of Gothic detail,
and is a good example of the early adaptation in England of Renaissance
architecture and ornamentation. It originally formed part of the
house, but in the nineteenth century, when some alterations to the
buildings were made, it was removed to the end of a walk in the gardens.
The dissolution of the monastery of St. Edith, on the site of which the
house stands, took place in 1539, and the abbey and its rich possessions
were granted by the King to Sir William Herbert shortly afterwards.
In the erection of his mansion the first Earl no doubt employed one
of the architects then attached to Henry’s court, for there is little in
the design of this small porch to support the tradition that the man
he selected was Holbein, rather than one of the Italians whose business
it was to invent and embellish such buildings. It is, indeed, simpler
in design and less lavish in ornamental detail than those architectural
backgrounds to his windows which Holbein produced when in Basel,
based upon recollections of his visit to Italy. The size of the porch
may be gauged by the entrance-way, which measures 8 feet in height.
Round the three outer doorways runs an interlaced design cut in low
relief, which still retains much of its original colour, the ground a rich
red and the ornament yellow, from which the original gilding has worn
away. In the corners a wreath of fruit and flowers encircles a small
wyvern on a blue background. Above the capitals of the fluted pillars,
and just below the projecting mouldings that divide the upper and
lower portions of the porch, is a broad band filled with a pattern of
intersecting circles, painted on a flat surface in light blue and yellow,
lined and touched with darker blue and red. Probably the whole
surface was originally painted and gilded. In the upper part the double
pillars are repeated, but with rich acanthus capitals. On the three
faces over the openings are panels with the Pembroke coat of arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>with a circular medallion on each side, containing heads of men and
women in relief, those on the front being apparently busts of the Earl
and his wife. The vigorous heraldic design supported by the Talbot
dogs and wyverns forms a novel finish to the crown. The interior
has a ribbed and vaulted ceiling, and brackets and other details in
bold relief, including a number of figures on pedestals. It is, of course,
possible that Holbein provided drawings for the building of this porch,
but there is no real evidence of this, and the style of the design does
not suggest his invention. It is much more likely to have been due to
one of Henry’s Italians, such as Antonio Toto. “The character of the
whole,” says Woltmann, “as is shown especially in the crowning, is
far too feeble for us to think of Holbein as its architect; and, besides
this, the costume of the half-length figures, introduced in several of
the medallions, shows that the work was executed near the close of
the sixteenth century.”<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c020'><b>[616]</b></a> Wornum also calls attention to the lateness
of the costumes, and says of the porch itself that it displays
“neither taste nor knowledge of the style.” He adds: “As for the
Whitehall Gate, it was a mongrel of Gothic and Renaissance quite
unworthy of Holbein, and, I should imagine, an impossible design for
him; it was similar in general character to the gate of St. James’s
Palace, at the bottom of St. James’s Street.”<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c020'><b>[617]</b></a> Waagen says that
the medallions contain busts of Edward VI and the Pembroke family.<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c020'><b>[618]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Among the architectural works by Holbein, which, if they were
ever carried out, cannot now be traced, must be placed his very admirable
design in the British Museum for a magnificent chimney-piece<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c020'><b>[619]</b></a>
for one of Henry VIII’s palaces, in all probability Bridewell.
It is conceived in the finest Renaissance taste, and is covered with
elaborate and beautiful ornamentation. It is in two stages, each
flanked by a pair of fluted pillars carrying richly-decorated entablatures.
The upper part is divided into six divisions, the three higher ones containing
the royal arms and motto, and the king’s initials and badges,
the portcullis and fleur-de-lis. The central panel of the lower range
represents a battle of horsemen, and the two on either side contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>circular medallions with figures of Charity and Justice, charming
compositions, in which beauty of form is rendered with all that freedom
and life-like accuracy which characterise everything Holbein produced,
even his most hasty sketches. The lower part of the fireplace, over
the open hearth, on which the logs are shown burning across two fire-dogs,
is filled with a semicircular lunette, with a second scene of
horsemen engaged in furious combat, in the centre of which is a
wreathed medallion with figures of Esther and Ahasuerus. In the
spandrels are smaller rounds with the heads of a lady and a helmeted
warrior. On the bases of the pillars on either side are blank tablets
for inscriptions, surrounded by scroll-work. This splendid fireplace
was evidently intended to occupy an important position in one of the
King’s buildings, as the frequent occurrence of his initials and the
presence of the royal coat of arms and badges indicate. Peacham,
in his <i>Compleat Gentleman</i>, when speaking of Holbein, says that he has
seen “of his owne draught with a penne, a most curious chimney-peece
K. <i>Henry</i> had bespoke for his new built pallace at <i>Bridewell</i>,” and there
is no doubt that this is the drawing to which he referred. It is in pen
and ink, with Indian-ink wash and slight colour, 21¼ in. × 16¾ in.,
and was formerly in the Arundel,<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c020'><b>[620]</b></a> Richardson, and Walpole collections.
It is possible that Holbein made similar designs for Nonsuch Palace.
In this drawing Mr. Digby Wyatt thought he saw the same designer
as the one who produced the beautiful woodwork of King’s College
Chapel, Cambridge. This important work, he says, “I cannot hesitate
to believe must have been executed from his designs.... In
its way it is a model of Renaissance wood-carving, revealing in every
arabesque, and especially in the ornaments of the lunettes, the
peculiarities of classical form as they were first, if I may use the expression,
<i>translated</i> from the Italian into German by Albert Dürer,
Altdorfer, Peter Vischer, and others, including Holbein.”<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c020'><b>[621]</b></a> The ceiling
of the chapel of St. James’s Palace has also been attributed to
Holbein, though without any evidence but that of style. This ceiling,
says Wornum, “is a curious work, a panelled Renaissance design,
and tastefully coloured. It was repaired in 1836 by Sir R. Smirke;
the general ground is blue; the panellings are defined by ribs of wood
gilt; there are also ornaments in foliage, painted green; and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>are many coats of arms emblazoned in their proper colours. A small
running open ornament, cast in lead, enriches the under sides of the
ribs. The date 1540 occurs in several places, and various short inscriptions
are scattered about, as—Henricus Rex 8—H and A, for
Henry and Anne of Cleves, with a lover’s knot between them.”<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c020'><b>[622]</b></a> His
work in connection with the internal decoration of Whitehall, including
the great fresco in the Privy Chamber and the ceiling in the Matted
Gallery, mentioned by Pepys, has been already described.<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c020'><b>[623]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>MORE CHAPEL IN CHELSEA CHURCH</div>
<p class='c023'>One more work of an architectural nature, attributed to Holbein
by Mr. F. M. Nichols in his paper, to which reference has been already
made, read before the Society of Antiquaries in March 1898, must be
noted. In the design of the two capitals<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c020'><b>[624]</b></a> supporting the arch which
divides the chancel of old Chelsea Church from the More Chapel he
“recognised at once the characteristic invention of Holbein.” Each
capital is “founded upon the suggestion of a classical capital of the
composite order. But the antique model is treated with a freedom
which would scarcely have commended itself to the taste of an Italian
artist.” They are capitals of half columns, there being only a single
arch between the chapel and the chancel, and each capital, like the
pillars, has five sides, as the columns, if completed, would be octagonal.
In the eastern capital the volutes terminate in a projecting human
head, and in each hollow of the abacus above is inserted the winged
head of a cherub. The acanthus-leaf design which covers the lower
part has various objects introduced among the foliage, such as a
shield with More’s arms and his crest of a Moor’s head, a sword crossed
with a sceptre, a mace, and two ornamented tablets, one of which
bears the date 1528 in Arabic numerals. The western capital is of a
somewhat similar design. Human heads take the place of those of
the cherubs, and the five sides below display various religious emblems
and ornaments, such as crossed candlesticks, a bundle of tapers, a
pail of holy water with sprinkling-brush, a clasped prayer-book or
missal, and a blank shield. These objects clearly have reference to
the religious ceremonies in which More was accustomed to take part
in the chapel, while the ornaments on the other capital may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>reference to his secular employments. The Holbeinesque character
of the designs, combined with the locality of Chelsea, the association
with Sir Thomas, and the date 1528, during the earlier part of which
year Holbein was still in England, are sufficient, in Mr. Nichols’
opinion, to prove that Holbein was the designer. Mr. Beaver, in his
<i>Memorials of Chelsea</i>, in discussing the authorship of these capitals,
rejects their attribution to Holbein on the ground that they have an
Italian character, and may be more probably ascribed to one of the
Italian artists then employed in this country; and most architects
who have made a close study of this period are in agreement with him.
“But,” says Mr. Nichols, “there are abundant examples in Holbein’s
work of his fondness for architectural details of a Renaissance type....
An Italian architect would scarcely have dealt so freely with the just
proportions of the classic capital upon which his design was founded.
And I am inclined to think that there was only one artist in England
at that time who combined the fertility of invention and the graceful
mastery of detail shown in these capitals with the boldness and freedom
with which the classic model is treated.”<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c020'><b>[625]</b></a> Mr. Reginald Blomfield is
of opinion that these carvings are of French origin. He says: “The
names of French artists or workmen scarcely ever occur in the State
Papers, and there are few instances of Renaissance work in England
which can be attributed to them. The capitals to the arch between
the More chantry and the chancel of old Chelsea Church are an unusual
instance. They closely resemble French work of the early sixteenth
century such as is found along the banks of the Seine between Paris
and Rouen. The monument in the Oxenbrigge Chapel in Brede
Church, Sussex, dated 1537, is another rare example. It is of Caen
stone, admirably carved, and was probably made in France and shipped
to the port of Rye, some nine miles distant from Brede.”<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c020'><b>[626]</b></a></p>

Blomfield, after his attention had been called to Mr. Nichols’ paper,
states that he adheres to his opinion that the Chelsea capitals are of
French origin.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In the same paper Mr. Nichols also draws attention to a two-light
stained-glass window in the south chapel of the village church of
Shelton in Norfolk, which contains figures of Sir John Shelton and his
wife, Ann, daughter of Sir William Boleyn and aunt to Henry VIII’s
second queen, a lady well known about the court, who at one time had
charge of the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth. The work, in Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Nichols’ opinion, is evidently of foreign origin, being totally different
from the English glass of the same period within a few feet of it, and
the faces and figures being executed more in the manner of a picture
than of stained glass. The foreign origin of the work is shown, among
other indications, by the peculiar treatment of the heraldry, which
has a decidedly German character. Both figures are represented
kneeling, Sir John in a crimson robe lined with fur, and his dame in a
contemporary dress of crimson, with the English angular head-dress.
The heads appear to have been carefully drawn from good portrait-studies
supplied to the glazier. Calculating from the known age and
date of Sir John Shelton’s death and his appearance in the window,
Mr. Nichols holds that these portrait-studies must have been made
about 1527, and he is of opinion that Holbein’s was the hand which
supplied some foreign glazier with the designs for them. Neither of
the heads, however, is to be found among the Windsor series.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S DESIGNS FOR JEWELLERS</div>
<p class='c023'>It is when we turn to Holbein’s work for jewellers and silversmiths
that the extraordinary fertility and happiness of his invention and the
beauty of his design are seen to the greatest advantage. Some hundreds
of his working drawings in this branch of art still exist, the
greater number of which are in the British Museum and at Basel, those
in the latter collection being for the most part contained in a sketch-book
of his later English period; indeed, most of the drawings which
have survived were produced in England, though he must have carried
out a considerable body of work of the same nature while in Basel.
When he came to London he was already a master of decorative design
as applied to most of the handicrafts, and his influence soon made
itself felt among a number of the craftsmen employed by Henry and
his court. His wonderful skill in the production of fine Renaissance
ornamentation of the purest taste, combined with a happy use of the
human figure, set a fashion in jewellery and personal ornament, and
inspired those who carried out his designs to a greater beauty and
delicacy of workmanship. The impetus he gave was in the direction
of fresh models of beautiful form in place of the mannerisms of Gothic
art into which the decorative crafts had sunk in this country at the
period of his first arrival in England. Even at so early an age he
already possessed, in addition to his skill in painting and drawing
and book illustration, a thorough knowledge of the rules of composition
and design according to the best Italian traditions, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>well versed in the use of the forms and proportions of classical architecture
and ornament, in addition to possessing practical skill in the
true application of design to the various art crafts and industries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DESIGNS FOR CUPS AND GOBLETS</div>
<p class='c023'>Holbein’s most elaborate design for goldsmiths’ work which has
survived is the one known as the Jane Seymour Cup, which was evidently
made to the order of the King at about the time of his marriage
with that lady in 1536. Two drawings for this exist in pen and ink, the
more highly-finished one, which is washed with colour and gold, being
in the Bodleian Library, Oxford,<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c020'><b>[627]</b></a> and the other in the British Museum,<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c020'><b>[628]</b></a>
the latter (<a href='#pl-41'>Pl. 41</a>), which is 17¾ in. × 9½ in., showing slight modifications.
The cup is a covered one, of a very beautiful shape, the lines of
which are not disguised or confused by the lavish ornamentation with
which it is covered. The body is set with four circular medallions
containing busts of “antique heads” in high relief, the one facing the
spectator being a woman with bared breast. Above them is a deep band
of exceptionally beautiful interlacing ornament of floriated design;
and below a smaller band with the initials of Henry and his Queen,
entwined with true-lovers’ knots, alternating with square-cut precious
stones set as flowers, and similar bands of precious stones at the base,
and round the rim of the cover. The stem is decorated with hanging
pearls and dolphins, cupids’ heads, and wreaths, and a narrow band
containing the motto of the Queen, “Bound to Obey and Serve,”
which is repeated on the cover. The latter is of very light and graceful
design, with two grotesque figures terminating in fish-tails blowing
foliated trumpets, and above them two cupids supporting a shield
surmounted by the royal crown. When carried out in gold the general
effect must have been one of extraordinary richness and beauty.
That it was so completed is proved by the fact that the cup itself was
still in the royal collection at the accession of Charles I in 1625. In
an inventory of that date it is thus described: “Item a faire standing
Cupp of Goulde, garnished about the cover with eleaven Dyamonds,
and two poynted Dyamonds about the Cupp, seaventeene Table Dyamonds
and one Pearle Pendent uppon the Cupp, with theis words
<span class='fss'>BOVND TO OBEY AND SERVE</span>, and H and I knitt together; in the
Topp of the Cover the Queenes Armes, an Queene Janes Armes houlden
by twoe Boyes under a Crowne Imperiall, weighing Threescore and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>five ounces and a halfe.” No further traces of this masterpiece of
the goldsmith’s art exist. In spite of its beauty, it was most
probably melted down, like much of the royal plate, to meet the
demands of an impoverished exchequer. It is, indeed, a matter
of the keenest regret that, in spite of the hundreds of designs with
which Holbein furnished the London goldsmiths or the Basel
armourers, not a single example of work so carried out remains, and
his achievements in this branch of art can only be judged from his
working drawings.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>His designs for cups with covers, goblets, tankards, and other
table vessels, which from the richness of their ornament were evidently
intended for ceremonious occasions, are numerous. Some of them are
only known through Hollar’s etchings, while the drawings for the
remainder are for the most part in the Basel Gallery. The most
interesting of them is the standing cup and cover in the Basel sketch-book,
which Holbein designed for his friend Hans von Antwerp (<a href='#pl-42'>Pl. 42</a>),<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c020'><b>[629]</b></a>
which may have been intended by the latter as an addition to the
collection of plate in the guild-hall of the Steelyard merchants. The
left-hand half has been drawn with the pen, from which the other half
has been transferred by damping and pressure. The broad, flat body
has a deep band of ornament containing nude figures blowing trumpets
amid foliage, and a somewhat similar band round the base, and
on the crest of the cover is the nude figure of Truth holding a book
and a lighted torch. By the side is an alternative design for this
figure. Round the rim of the cover is inscribed <span class='fss'>HANS VON ANT[WERPEN]</span>.
Another cup and cover, or table ornament, with a wide stand, of which
only the left side is shown, though much more hasty in execution, is
a more highly elaborated piece of decoration, in which small nude
standing figures are combined with leafage and festoons.<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c020'><b>[630]</b></a> On the
side of the sheet are a number of alternative sketches for various details.
There is no need to describe at length the other designs for
covered cups in the Basel Gallery, one of which is surmounted by the
nude figure of a woman with right arm extended and the left hand
resting on a shield;<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c020'><b>[631]</b></a> while a second design has a figure of Justice,
and on the base a medallion with the bust of a lady in sixteenth-century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>costume.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c020'><b>[632]</b></a> Several studies for tankards are to be found among Hollar’s
etchings. These etchings indicate the existence at one time of
a third sketch-book or set of designs, which, at the time when Hollar
worked from it, was in the possession of the Earl of Arundel, but has
since disappeared.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>One of the most important of Holbein’s designs in the British
Museum is the large drawing in pen and ink and Indian-ink wash, of
an astronomical clock, which was formerly in the Mariette and Horace
Walpole collections (<a href='#pl-43'>Pl. 43</a>).<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c020'><b>[633]</b></a> This clock, the design for which must
have been one of Holbein’s last undertakings, was presented to Henry
VIII by Sir Anthony Denny on New Year’s Day, 1544, shortly after the
painter’s death. It consists of an hour-glass enclosed within a case,
the doors of which stand open in the drawing, with a terminal figure
of a satyr in the centre, which recalls the very similar figure in the
full-length woodcut portrait of Erasmus. The hour-glass rests on a
pedestal with legs, supported at the corners with other terminal
figures of satyrs, and having a circular space in the centre left blank
in the drawing. On the decorated crown of the case stand two nude
boys—for which there is an alternative design in the British Museum
on one of the leaves of the Sloane sketch-book<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c020'><b>[634]</b></a>—each pointing to a
sundial of metal curved outwards in an arc, for which their fingers
serve as gnomon. On their heads rests a mechanical clock with a
sun-face in the centre of the dial with fiery locks, one of which forms
the pointer, the whole surmounted by a crown. On the left side of
the sheet is a compass, probably intended to fit inside the clock-case.
The drawing is inscribed, in Sir Anthony Denny’s own handwriting:
“Strena facta pro anthony deny camerario regio quod in initio novi
anni 1544 regi dedit.” He was then King’s Chamberlain, and was
knighted in the September of the year in which he made his royal
master this handsome gift. Other notes occur on the drawing, here
and there illegible, made evidently for the guidance of the craftsman
who carried out Holbein’s design, which is simpler, though no less
characteristic in style, than his drawing for Queen Jane Seymour’s
gold cup.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DESIGNS FOR SHEATHS AND HILTS</div>
<p class='c023'>His designs for sword and dagger hilts, sheaths, and various ornaments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>for sword-belts and weapons are numerous, and again display
his extraordinary fertility of invention and his power of combining
the human figure with conventional floral and grotesque Renaissance
ornament into a decorative whole of the utmost elegance and beauty.
One of the finest, and most elaborate, is the large pen-and-wash drawing,
17⅞ in. × 4⅝ in., in the British Museum, which was purchased in
1874 from the Earl of Wicklow’s collection (<a href='#pl-44'>Pl. 44</a>).<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c020'><b>[635]</b></a> The handle has
spiral bands set with stones, and numerous pearls are also set in the
sheath, the hilt, and the guard. These gems are held or supported by a
number of nude figures of women, old men, satyrs, and children amid
foliage, each one full of individual character, and drawn as only Holbein
could draw them. It was evidently intended for execution in
chiselled gold or silver, and produces an effect of great splendour. Only
the right half of the sheath is drawn, as the design was to be repeated
on the other side. There is an alternative design for parts of
the hilt in the Basel Gallery.<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c020'><b>[636]</b></a> In the latter collection there is
also a study for the sheath of a short sword or cutlass in which a
somewhat similar arrangement has been carried out.<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c020'><b>[637]</b></a> It is an offset
taken by Holbein from a pen-and-ink drawing. Another of the Basel
designs is for a powder-flask, possibly to be executed in bone or
ivory, in which naked cupids are intermingled with the foliage.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c020'><b>[638]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>There is a splendid design for a dagger sheath in the Bernburg Ducal
Library, which is divided into four compartments, the three upper ones
containing figures in settings of Renaissance architecture.<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c020'><b>[639]</b></a> In the
uppermost is a group representing the Judgment of Paris. The youth, in
sixteenth-century costume, reclines with his back against a pillar
with Mercury bending over him and offering him the apple, the three
goddesses standing in front of him, and Cupid aiming at him with a bow
and arrow. The next division shows the deaths of Pyramus, a cleverly
foreshortened figure beneath a fountain, and Thisbe, who is stabbing
herself by his body. Below is Venus within a scalloped niche, with the
long ass’s ears of a jester, and a blindfolded cupid at her feet. The
lowest compartment contains scroll-work, the whole terminating in a
cherub’s head within volutes, with the initial H. at the bottom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>There is a slighter preliminary pen study for this sheath in the Basel
Gallery, which shows a number of differences (<a href='#pl-45'>Pl. 45 (3)</a>).<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c020'><b>[640]</b></a> Another
dagger sheath at Basel is of particular interest because it is dated
1529,<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c020'><b>[641]</b></a> and so must have been drawn in Basel after Holbein’s return
from his first visit to England (<a href='#pl-45'>Pl. 45 (1)</a>). The design consists
entirely of conventional foliage, seen against a black background, as
though to be executed in chiselled open-work over some black material
such as velvet, or to be filled in with niello. There are other sheaths
in which the subject stands out against a plain black background,
one, in Berlin, with a Dance of Death,<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c020'><b>[642]</b></a> of which there is a repetition at
Basel (<a href='#pl-46'>Pl. 46 (1)</a>),<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c020'><b>[643]</b></a> which appears to be an impression taken from the
Berlin drawing, strengthened and finished with Indian-ink, by some
other hand than Holbein’s; and another in the British Museum, with
a Triumph of Bellona,<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c020'><b>[644]</b></a> of which only the sheath is by him. The hilt
is obviously the work of some other designer, in all probability, according
to the British Museum catalogue, Peter Flötner of Nuremberg.
It was formerly in the Beckford Collection, and consists of two pieces
of paper joined together, the hilt on one and the sheath on the other.
Another sheath in the Basel Gallery is decorated with a Roman
Triumph (<a href='#pl-46'>Pl. 46 (2)</a>),<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c020'><b>[645]</b></a> slightly drawn, in the manner of Mantegna,
recalling the frieze in the 1517 portrait of Benedikt von Hertenstein;
and a second of a like quality, representing Joshua’s Passage of the
Jordan (<a href='#pl-46'>Pl. 46 (3)</a>).<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c020'><b>[646]</b></a> Other designs for the knobs and cross-pieces
of dagger hilts will be found in the British Museum (<a href='#pl-47'>Pl. 47</a>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DESIGNS FOR PENDANTS AND JEWELS</div>
<p class='c023'>The sketch-book bequeathed to the British Museum by Sir Hans
Sloane in 1753 contains nearly two hundred drawings, almost all of
them designs for jewellery and other small objects for personal use
or adornment, such as belt tassels and buckles, book covers with rings
for attachment to girdles, seals, portable sundials, pendants and
brooches. Henry VIII was lavish in his use of jewellery, and the
fashion he set was slavishly followed by his courtiers. Dresses were
loaded with gems and elaborate specimens of the goldsmith’s art,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and this delight in finery was carried to such an extent that it was a
topic for jest and sarcasm among foreigners. More than one contemporary
account gives details of the King’s costume and the many jewels
which adorned it, and the long inventories of his clothes and personal
ornaments which still exist prove that continental visitors to his
court did not exaggerate in the descriptions of his person which they
sent home. French and Italian jewellers paid frequent visits to London,
and sold him many gems and beautiful specimens of gold and silver
work and other art objects, while he regularly employed a large number
of English and resident foreign jewellers. Their services were most
in demand about New Year’s Day, when gifts were showered upon
his Majesty, and he in return made many presents, often of great
value. There is no doubt that some of these gifts were designed by
Holbein, and that he served as designer to several of the leading
London goldsmiths. The British Museum Collection contains many
designs for pendants and for jewels which were suspended round the
neck by a ribbon or chain, this attachment being shown in a number
of the studies (<a href='#pl-48'>Pl. 48</a>). In most of them table diamonds and other
flat stones, together with pearls, are arranged in geometric patterns,
the interstices being filled with strap, scroll, or ribbon-work, or
some conventional floral design. Occasionally at the top of the jewel
there is
a small grotesque or nude figure (<a href='#pl-49'>Pl. 49</a>). Many of the designs have a
black ground indicating niello or champlevé enamel. In some instances,
however, the blackening may have been done merely to indicate the
design more clearly to the craftsman who was to carry it out. Some
of them are coloured and are often touched with gold, so that it is
possible to tell the jewels and materials it was intended to use.
Several pendants are in the shape of a cross, and others heart-shaped;
one of the latter is of gold, with three pendant pearls, and two doves
billing on a green bough in enamel, with the motto, <span class='fss'>TVRTVRVM CONCORDIA</span>
(<a href='#pl-48'>Pl. 48 (3)</a>).<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c020'><b>[647]</b></a> Another shows the bust of a woman in Tudor
dress holding between her hands a large table-cut stone, across which is
written, apparently in another hand, “Well Laydi Well” (<a href='#pl-49'>Pl. 49 (9)</a>).<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c020'><b>[648]</b></a>
Several pendants are in the form of monograms, a very fine one consisting
of the letters R. and E. in gold, with two rubies, an emerald,
and a garnet at the four corners, hung by a ribbon above and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>three pearls below (<a href='#pl-48'>Pl. 48 (7)</a>);<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c020'><b>[649]</b></a> many of the designs, in fact, show
one or more pearls suspended in this fashion. A jewel very similar
to the last-named, formed of the sacred monogram, is worn by Jane
Seymour in her portrait at Vienna. Another pendant monogram, with
the initials H and I and an emerald in the centre (<a href='#pl-48'>Pl. 48 (6)</a>), was
evidently designed for the King and his third Queen.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c020'><b>[650]</b></a> Several of them
have mottoes, such as <span class='fss'>QVAM ACCIPERE DARE MVLTO BEATIVS</span> (<a href='#pl-49'>Pl. 49 (7)</a>),<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c020'><b>[651]</b></a>
or <span class='fss'>PRVDENTEMENT ET PAR COMPAS INCONTINENT VIENDRAS</span>,<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c020'><b>[652]</b></a> the latter
on a round device of two horns of plenty, two dolphins and a pair of
compasses with serpents writhing round them (<a href='#pl-50'>Pl. 50 (8)</a>). Among the
brooches there is one consisting of three diamonds enwreathed by a
scroll, on which is inscribed, <span class='sc'>Mi Ladi Prinsis</span>, and the same motto
occurs on a second.<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c020'><b>[653]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>There are two designs for book bindings with rings for suspension, no
doubt covers for a prayer book. They are decorated with metal and
enamel in arabesque patterns, and one of them has the initials T.W. in
the centre, which are repeated in the corners, T.W. above and W.T.
below.<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c020'><b>[654]</b></a> On the second the same initials are combined with an I,<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c020'><b>[655]</b></a>
and in both cases it is probable that they were intended for Sir
Thomas Wyat. Two very similar designs appear to be for a jewelcase,
or perhaps a portable reliquary.<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c020'><b>[656]</b></a> There is also an interesting
drawing of a seal with the coat of arms of Charles Brandon, Duke of
Suffolk, within the garter and its motto, and around the whole a
circular band inscribed <span class='fss'>CAROLVS DVX SVFFYCIE PRO HONORE SVO
RICHEMOND</span> (<a href='#pl-50'>Pl. 50 (4)</a>).<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c020'><b>[657]</b></a> Among the remaining studies are
various devices, coats of arms, including Holbein’s own (<a href='#pl-50'>Pl. 50 (6)</a>),
book clasps, bracelets, chains (<a href='#pl-50'>Pl. 51 (3, 4, and 5)</a>), collars, rings,
a number of monograms (<a href='#pl-48'>Pl. 48 (1)</a>), some of them
containing as many as eleven letters, probably concealing a complete
name or the initials of the words of some device, grotesque figures,
winged warriors, nude women, and satyrs—the latter in some cases
certainly intended for the foot of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>vase, box, or salt-cellar, or some such table ware—together with a
variety of ornaments for which the exact purpose is not indicated.
These last are largely fragments of circular borders or segments of
discs, decorated with arabesques on enamel (<a href='#pl-52'>Pl. 52</a>). In some of
these designs for enamel the pattern is in white on a ground of blue and
red or blue and black.</p>

<p class='c023'>Among the designs at Basel is a very charming and humorous
upright band or panel, for goldsmith’s work (#Pl. 45 (2):pl-45),<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c020'><b>[658]</b></a> in which
eight bears are shown climbing among the leaves of a vine accompanied
by a little man with a high peaked cap blowing a trumpet and
beating a drum, a design no doubt suggested to Holbein by the sight
of some travelling showman with a troupe of performing animals.
Two other bands of ornament in the Basel Gallery, in which the design
is arranged horizontally, represent in one case a humorous frieze with
nude children,<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c020'><b>[659]</b></a> and in the other similar children with dogs hunting

The latter is a carefully-finished drawing, in which the small figures
are arranged with great decorative effect among curved Renaissance
ornamentation of conventional floriated design. In the same collection
there are several elaborately decorated mirror-frames.</p>

<p class='c023'>There remains one particular form of personal ornament for which
Holbein’s services as designer were in constant demand. This was the
circular medallion or <i>enseigne</i> worn on the hat, and also, in
the case of ladies, as a pendant at the end of a chain or ribbon, or
in the shape of a brooch fastened to the front of the dress. They
usually bore some figure-subject, the earlier examples being, as a
rule, religious, with figures or emblems of saints or scenes from the
Scriptures. In course of time subjects taken from classical story or
mediæval legend were used, and designs of a fanciful and allegorical
nature. They became highly popular forms of personal adornment, and
French and Italian jewellers brought numbers of them over to London.
“Every one, from the highest rank downwards,” says Mr. H. Clifford
Smith, “had his personal <i>devise</i> or <i>impresa</i>, or more
often a series of them. It was worn as an emblem—an ingenious
expression of some conceit of the wearer, the outcome of his peculiar
frame of mind. It usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>contained some obscure meaning, the sense of which, half hidden and
half revealed, was intended to afford some play for the ingenuity of
the observer. The love of the time for expressing things by riddles
led to the publication of sets of emblems, like those of Alciatus, which
had imitations in all directions. Every one, in fact, tried his hand at
these ‘toys of the imagination.’”<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c020'><b>[661]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>That these hat-badges and brooches were worn by almost every
one at Henry’s court is shown by their representation in many of
Holbein’s pictures and in a large number of the Windsor drawings.
In the latter, unfortunately, the subjects are so slightly indicated
that it is impossible in most cases to make them out. They are to be
found almost invariably in the portraits of courtiers, the learned
doctors and the more soberly-attired German merchants not using
them. Those worn by the more wealthy were generally of gold, with
the design in repoussé work, frequently enamelled in colours, and
often with precious stones set in them. They were, as a rule, surrounded
by a border or framework of similar workmanship, sometimes set with
jewels. Some of them were fastened with a pin, like a brooch, others
had loops or small holes round the edges so that they could be sewn
to the hat. Henry VIII possessed a large collection of these ornaments.
In a list dated 1526 there is mentioned, among many others,
a crimson velvet bonnet, double turfed, with a brooch of St. Michael
set with diamonds, and a white rose on one side and a red rose on the
other; and another of a buttoned cap of black velvet with a diamond
and a brooch of Paris work of St. James. Other hats had brooches
representing “three men and a pearl in the back of one of them”;
a lady leading a brace of greyhounds; Venus and Cupids; a lady holding
a heart in her hand; another lady holding a crown; another with
a cameo head and a hanging pearl; “a man standing on a faggot of
fire”; “a handful of feathers”; “a gentleman in a lady’s lap”;
and St. George, Hercules, and so on.<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c020'><b>[662]</b></a> In another list, two years later
in date, there is mentioned “a brooch with a gentlewoman luting,
with a scripture over it.”<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c020'><b>[663]</b></a> Occasionally these <i>enseignes</i> are described
as “valentines of goldsmith’s work.” Most of the King’s hats were
also lavishly decorated with gold aglets.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>None of the jewels included in these earlier lists can have been
designed by Holbein; but after he became attached to the court he
appears to have been constantly employed in this way, and it became,
no doubt, the fashion to wear an <i>enseigne</i> or medallion of his
devising. Among his drawings, in the British Museum, at Basel, and at
Chatsworth, there are a number of small circular designs with
figure-subjects which were evidently intended for such purposes.
Unfortunately, only in one single case has a design been found among
his sketches which corresponds with the gold-and-enamel badge worn by
the sitter in one of his finished pictures—the beautiful little
drawing of “Lot and his Daughters” in the British Museum (<a href='#pl-50'>Pl. 50 (2)</a>),
which, as recently pointed out by Mr. Lionel Cust, was the design for
the medallion shown in the portrait of Catherine Howard.<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c020'><b>[664]</b></a> Very
possibly some of the other <i>enseignes</i> or pendant roundels
represented in his portraits were of his own devising, but they are
painted on so small a scale that the subjects upon them are difficult
to decipher.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f664'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r664'>664</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See pp. <a href='#Page_195'>195</a>-<a href='#Page_196'>196</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The medallion of “Lot and his Daughters” forms one of a numerous
series of roundels, usually about 2½ in. in diameter, with subjects
taken from the Old Testament, the greater number of which are in
the Basel sketch-book. Among the latter are three different studies
on one sheet for the subject of Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness,<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c020'><b>[665]</b></a>
and a fourth with Sarah giving Hagar to her husband;<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c020'><b>[666]</b></a> the Sacrifice
of Cain and Abel;<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c020'><b>[667]</b></a> Jacob embracing Rachel;<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c020'><b>[668]</b></a> Jacob causing the
stone to be removed from the well for Rachel,<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c020'><b>[669]</b></a> a very beautiful little
drawing with an interesting group of buildings in the background;
David and the Woman of Tekoah kneeling before him;<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c020'><b>[670]</b></a> the Sacrifice
of Elijah, in which a jewel is inset to depict the fire on the altar;<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c020'><b>[671]</b></a>
and Moses and the destruction of Korah and his company.<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c020'><b>[672]</b></a> This
last is set within an open-work border with mermaids and cupids
amid scroll-work. Several other subjects from the Old Testament,
such as Judah and Tamar, and David playing before Saul, are to be
found among the engravings made by Wenceslaus Hollar from drawings
by Holbein, now lost, when in the Arundel Collection. Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the subjects from the New Testament at Basel are the Baptism of
Christ,<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c020'><b>[673]</b></a> the Last Judgment,<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c020'><b>[674]</b></a> and the Repentant Magdalen.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c020'><b>[675]</b></a> Two
designs of the Archangel Michael slaying the Dragon are for the badge
accompanying a chain of the order of St. Michael, and may have been
drawn from the badge belonging to Dinteville.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c020'><b>[676]</b></a> Another represents
the kneeling figures of a young couple in English dress holding a cup
with a heart over it, evidently for “a valentine of goldsmith’s work.”<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c020'><b>[677]</b></a>
Among the unknown subjects is one in which a nude man is standing
upon a prostrate knight, who with one hand shatters Cupid’s bow and
with the other breaks the fallen man’s sword;<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c020'><b>[678]</b></a> one which repeats
one of the subjects of the Basel Town Hall wall-paintings—the blinding
of Zaleucus;<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c020'><b>[679]</b></a> and others representing Juno and Callisto, Pomona,
Leucothea on a dolphin, and two Centaurs.<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c020'><b>[680]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>At Chatsworth there is a sheet of drawings containing six <i>enseignes</i>
and one larger design which appears to be for some kind of a sheath.<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c020'><b>[690]</b></a>
They are among the very finest examples of Holbein’s work in this
field, drawn with the greatest delicacy, and admirable in composition.
They represent (1) Hagar and Ishmael (<a href='#pl-53'>Pl. 53 (2)</a>), a variant of the
Basel design, in which the angel is flying towards Hagar, who is seated
under a tree, with the naked infant asleep under a bush, and on a
scroll the names “Hagar” and “Ismael”; (2) The Last Judgment
(<a href='#pl-53'>Pl. 53 (3)</a>), with Christ seated on clouds, and men and women kneeling
below, with figures struggling out of graves, and on one side the yawning
mouth of a dragon representing hell; (3) Icarus falling into the
sea (<a href='#pl-53'>Pl. 53 (1)</a>), his wings melted by the sun, and Phœbus driving his
chariot drawn by four winged horses through the sky; (4) Diana and
Actæon (<a href='#pl-53'>Pl. 53 (5)</a>), with four nude women standing in water on the
left, and Actæon on the bank already turning into a stag, with his
dogs attacking him, and others rushing through the wood in the background;
(5) three beehives on a wooden stand under a roof of rushes
(<a href='#pl-53'>Pl. 53 (6)</a>), with Cupid, blindfolded, his bow on the ground, holding
up his hands as though stung by the bees which are flying round him, and
below a shield for a coat of arms, coloured blue, and the motto, “<span class='fss'>NOCET
EMPTA DOLORE VOLUPTA</span>,” on a ribbon scroll, the whole surrounded
by a band of conventional scroll pattern; (6) a man in sixteenth-century
costume, with folded arms, asleep on the grass, under an oak
tree on a rocky piece of ground (<a href='#pl-53'>Pl. 53 (7)</a>). On the right is a large
clock with hanging weights, the hands pointing to twelve o’clock, and
the figure of a small child pulling the rope of the hammer which strikes
the bell. Round the trunk of the tree is a scroll with the legend
“<span class='fss'>ASPETTO LA HORA</span>” (I await the hour). This is possibly the design
for a watch-back. These medallions are in pen and bistre, with
touches of red in some of the figures, and green here and there in trees
or grass. The remaining design seems to be for a short, broad sheath,
but not, apparently, for a weapon (<a href='#pl-53'>Pl. 53 (4)</a>). It represents the Rape
of Helen, who stands on the seashore, seized by the arms by two men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>one wearing a helmet. A boat containing figures—some of them
waving their hands—is coming towards them over the water. There
are some buildings on the left, and at the bottom, in the foreground,
two nude figures with long spades digging in the sand. The leg of
one of these two figures projects beyond the boundary-line of the
sheath, showing that the design was not intended for a flat ornament,
but was to be continued on both sides of the object.<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c020'><b>[691]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The wide range of subject shown in these badges affords remarkable
proof of the fertility of Holbein’s invention. The great
number of them, too, indicates that he must have found regular and
lucrative employment in work for the London jewellers and goldsmiths.
Possibly those which remain formed only a small part of his
total output. It has been suggested, indeed, that none of the studies
which have survived were actually carried out as ornaments, but were
rather designs either rejected by the goldsmith or the patron for whom
Holbein was working, or were merely drawn by the artist as part of
his stock-in-trade, from which clients could make their selection.<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c020'><b>[692]</b></a>
This supposition is based on the fact that the drawings have always
been carefully preserved in the original sketch-books, and bear no
traces of having undergone the rough usage of a goldsmith’s workshop.
It does not seem at all probable, however, that this was the
case; it is, indeed, absurd to suppose that these designs, several hundreds
in number, and many of them of the greatest beauty, could have
been rejected as not good enough by those for whom they were prepared.
It has been seen that the design for the medallion with the
subject of Lot and his Daughters was actually carried out for the
adornment of Catherine Howard, to say nothing of those larger drawings
for the Jane Seymour Cup and the Denny astronomical clock,
which, in any case, cannot have been rejected designs. A much
simpler explanation is that Holbein kept his original designs by him
for future reference, and made other versions or copies, possibly
sometimes more elaborate in detail, for the use of the craftsmen who
carried them out.</p>

Designer,” in <i>Art Journal</i>, June 1910, p. 175.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>With the exception of the cup designed for Hans of Antwerp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>which shows that the two men worked together, it is impossible to
connect Holbein’s name directly with that of any one of the many
goldsmiths who served the court; but it is probable that he was employed
by at least several of them, and almost certainly by Cornelis
Hayes. There were an extraordinary number of such craftsmen, both
native and foreign, in London at that period, and many others, more
particularly Frenchmen and Italians, who paid periodical visits to
England in order to sell works of art and jewels to the King and the
nobility.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE KING’S JEWELLERS</div>
<p class='c023'>The leading London jeweller of the earlier part of Henry’s reign was
Robert Amadas, of Lombard Street, an alderman, who in 1526 was
appointed Master of the Jewel House, a post which he held until his
death in 1532, when he was succeeded by Thomas Cromwell. Other leading
goldsmiths were Alderman Sir John Mundy, appointed justice to
the merchants of the Steelyard in 1525,<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c020'><b>[693]</b></a> Alderman Robert Fenrother,
Gerard Hughes, Robert Lord, Nicholas and Henry Wooley, Thomas
Trappes, William Holland, John Twiselton, John van Utricke, and
Henry Holtesweller. Large sums were spent in New Year’s gifts,
the King both giving and receiving many very valuable presents.
Thus in 1520 £1208, 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was paid to Amadas, Twiselton, and
Holland for supplying such gifts, and in 1521 no less than £1679,
15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, while smaller sums were received by other goldsmiths.<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c020'><b>[694]</b></a> There
was also constant demand for gold and silver plate for presentation
to foreign ambassadors and envoys, and for christening presents for
the children of the King’s favourites. Amadas supplied many of
these, as well as seals, jewels, spangles and other ornaments for the
jackets of the King’s Guards, silver bells, bosses, and nails for his
Majesty’s use, and many other articles which need not be specified.
Amadas was dead before Holbein became attached to the court, and
it is not at all likely that the latter designed for him. He must, however,
have been well acquainted with the Dutchman, Cornelis Hayes,
or Heyes, who became a naturalised Englishman in January 1523,<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c020'><b>[695]</b></a>
and was afterwards one of the most regularly employed of the goldsmiths
specially appointed to the King’s service. He received licence
to keep six alien apprentices and twelve journeymen, notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the statute of 14 &amp; 15 Hen. VIII.<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c020'><b>[696]</b></a> He supplied many jewels for Anne
Boleyn, including “a diamond in a brooch of our Lady of Boulogne,”
and was employed, after Wolsey’s downfall, to remove the coat of
arms from the Cardinal’s plate and place thereon the royal arms instead.
He was also frequently occupied in repairing and altering the royal
jewels and badges. His possible co-operation with Holbein, in 1534,
in connection with the making of a silver cradle and figures of Adam
and Eve has been already mentioned,<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c020'><b>[697]</b></a> and also that the piece of plate
given to Holbein by the King in return for the portrait of Prince
Edward was made by Hayes.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c020'><b>[698]</b></a> Holbein and Hayes had a common
friend in Bourbon, the French poet, who stayed with the goldsmith
when in London.</p>

<p class='c023'>Another goldsmith of importance was the Welshman Morgan
Wolf, Fenwolf, or Phillip, one of the sewers of the chamber, and keeper
of the castle and lordship of Abergavenny. Both he and the Englishman
John Freeman supplied many New Year’s gifts and other goldsmith’s
work to Henry. The latter was a protégé of Cromwell’s, who
found him much employment in connection with the dissolution of
the monasteries, and granted him a number of fat appointments.
Morgan Wolf engraved the Great Seal of England in 1543.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c020'><b>[699]</b></a> Among
the foreign jewellers who came frequently to England, and some of
whom eventually settled here, were Alart Plumier, or Plymmer, as he
is called in the royal accounts, of Paris, who had frequent dealings
with the King; Jehan Lange, of the same city, who came over as the
representative of several Parisian houses; Hubert Morett,<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c020'><b>[700]</b></a> Christopher
Herrault, Peter Romaynes, Guillim Ottener, John Crispin, Latronet,
and Martin Garrard, the latter obtaining a patent of denization in
1535. To prolong the list of names would be only tedious, for it is
impossible to connect Holbein’s name definitely with any one of them,
though there is every probability that Cornelis Hayes and John of
Antwerp both worked in conjunction with him.</p>

The last important work upon which Holbein was engaged,
a work left unfinished owing to his sudden
death, was the large picture still hanging in the old
hall of the Barber-Surgeons’ Company in Monkwell
Street, London (<a href='#pl-54'>Pl. 54</a>).<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c020'><b>[701]</b></a> It was painted to commemorate
the unification of the Company of Barbers and
the Guild of Surgeons by Act of Parliament in the thirty-second year
of Henry’s reign (1540-41), and must have been begun shortly after
the passing of the Act. At an earlier period the barbers and
the surgeons of London had formed a single company, but in
course of time had become separated; and upon their second
coming together Holbein was called in to furnish a permanent
record of the event. During the progress of the work he painted
separate portraits of at least two of the sitters in the big picture—Dr.
John Chamber and Sir William Butts—just as he had painted individual
likenesses of Sir Thomas and Lady More when engaged upon the big
group of the Chancellor’s family.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f701'>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The truth of Van Mander’s statement that Holbein left this large
picture unfinished is apparent after even a cursory examination of it.
That writer, who regarded it as an “unusually splendid work,” says:</p>

<p class='c023'>“According to the feeling of some, Holbein is said not to have
completed the piece himself, but that the deficient parts were painted
by some one else. Nevertheless, if this be the truth, it must lead to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the conclusion that the completer of the work must have understood
how to follow Holbein’s manner so judiciously that no painter or
artist can from good reasons decide that various hands have been
engaged in it.”<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c020'><b>[702]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f702'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r702'>702</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Quoted by Woltmann, i. p. 474. Eng. trans., p. 444.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The latter part of Van Mander’s statement, however, is far from
correct, for the hand of a very inferior craftsman is plainly enough to
be discerned over a greater part of the picture. The general arrangement
of the kneeling figures in the front rank, and the position assigned
to the King, were evidently Holbein’s, who had probably finished the
heads, and even the robes, of several of the leading members of the
Guild, while the heads of others had possibly been traced on the panel
from his own preliminary studies before death cut short his labours.
For the rest, the picture appears to have suffered from more than
one later attempt to finish it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DESCRIPTION OF THE PICTURE</div>
<p class='c023'>The composition consists of nineteen figures. Henry VIII is
shown full-length on his throne, which is not placed in the centre of
the picture, but somewhat to the spectator’s left. He is crowned
and dressed in his full robes of state, holding the sword in his right
and the charter in his left hand. He is represented as far larger
in size than the other figures kneeling in front of him, something in
the manner of earlier days, when the importance of the principal person
in a painting was brought home to the spectator by the simple plan
of depicting him much bigger than those who surrounded him. This is
a trick to which such a master as Holbein would never have descended;
indeed, the figure of the King, who stares straight out of the picture
with a dull, wooden countenance, without evincing the slightest interest
in the ceremony in which he is the chief performer, cannot even
have been sketched in by Holbein, and is a stiff and clumsy performance
at the best. The head has evidently been copied from one of the
numerous likenesses of Henry of the type of the Warwick portrait,
without any attempt to alter the position of the face or to connect
it with the presentation which is taking place. The position of the head
may have been indicated by Holbein on the panel, and Woltmann is
probably right in his conjecture that it was his intention to represent
him standing on the steps of the throne, and not seated, which would
account for the height of the face as it now is above the surrounding
figures.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c020'><b>[703]</b></a> On the King’s right hand only three members of the Guild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>are kneeling—Chamber in the front, with Butts next, and T. Alsop
behind him. The three may have been thus placed in the position of
honour as the King’s personal physicians. All three wear a furred
gown and a doctor’s cap. The head of Chamber is excellent, and
appears to be wholly Holbein’s work, with little or no retouching;
that of Butts has suffered more severely from incompetent hands,
while the Alsop is much weaker. It is in this part of the picture, and
in one or two of the heads on the opposite side, that Holbein carried
his work almost entirely to completion. Eight men kneel in the front
row on the King’s left, headed by T. Vicary, who receives the charter
from the royal hand, five of them with beards, and some of them with
skull-caps, and wearing more elaborate costumes and gowns than those
opposite to them. The second figure, T. Aylif, the Warden, is one of
the most effective, the head, though here again retouching is very
evident, being perhaps the best of all. The heads of Harman and
Monforde are noteworthy among the remainder of the figures, the
greater number of which have been so badly repainted that no touch
of Holbein’s hand is now visible; though it is possible that in some
cases he was responsible for the outline. According to Dr. Woltmann,
traces of the pinholes by means of which the transference of Holbein’s
original sketches of the heads to the panel was made, can still be
seen in several instances. Behind the eight kneeling members of the
Company on the spectator’s right there appears an upper row of seven
figures, which must have been added at a considerably later date than
that of the finishing process given to the picture at some time shortly
after Holbein’s death. These later figures are so badly placed that they
entirely spoil the composition, and are quite devoid of artistic merit,
being the work of a still weaker hand than that of the unknown
“finisher.” They evidently formed no part of the original arrangement,
but represent later members of the company who wished their
portraits to be included. The panel is further marred by the fact that
over each sitter, with the exception of five in the last-named row,
his name is inscribed in large letters. Another late addition, which
also helps to spoil the general effect, is a large white tablet on the wall
on the right, which contains a long Latin inscription in prose and verse
in praise of the King. Originally this space was occupied by a window,
through which could be seen the old tower of the church of St. Bride’s,
showing that the ceremony was represented as taking place in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>palace of Bridewell. Behind the King hangs a large gold-embroidered
curtain, and on either side of it the space is roughly filled in with
flowers and fruit representing tapestry. According to Dr. Ganz,<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c020'><b>[704]</b></a>
it is the same chamber, with the same hangings, probably the throne-room
in Whitehall, as in the large picture of the family of Henry VIII
at Hampton Court (No. 340 (510)),<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c020'><b>[705]</b></a> which has been attributed by some
writers to Guillim Stretes; and again, in a portrait of Queen Elizabeth
in the possession of the Earl of Buckinghamshire. It is possible that
the King may have sat for the picture at Whitehall, and that
Holbein made use of the surroundings at his hand, but the view
from the window in the copy of the Barber-Surgeons painting,
mentioned below, seems to indicate that the room represented was in
Bridewell. There is no resemblance between the patterns of the carpets
in the two pictures. It is painted on a panel made up of a number
of thick, vertical oak boards, and is 10 ft. 3 in. wide by 6 ft. high. In
Woltmann’s opinion, “the picture is nothing but a ruin, in which we
have to search with difficulty for the traces of Holbein.”<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c020'><b>[706]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>This opinion, and an almost similar one given by Wornum, were
regarded by the late Sir Charles Robinson as far too scathing.<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c020'><b>[707]</b></a> He
considered that Holbein’s hand had worked more or less over every part
of the great panel—very elaborately and minutely in some parts and
very slightly in others; but that nowhere had the finishing touches
and work required to give final truth and perfection of representation
been bestowed. He thought that an interval of some twenty or thirty
years must have elapsed before the Barber-Surgeons, in an inauspicious
moment, determined on the completion of their picture, the
superadded work seeming to be that of a somewhat advanced Elizabethan
period. It must always be a matter of deep regret that they
did not leave it in the state in which it came to them from Holbein’s
studio, for it would have been of infinitely greater value than it is now.
Finished by him it could not have been less than a masterpiece; but
even in its incomplete state it would have been of equal interest as
forming an invaluable example of his technique and methods of working.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>COPY MADE FOR JAMES I</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>On the 13th of January 1618 James I wrote from Newmarket to
the Company asking that the picture should be lent to him, as he was
anxious to have a copy made of it, and promising that this should be
done expeditiously, and the original redelivered safely. “We are
informed,” he said, “there is a table of Painting in your Hall whereon
is the Picture of our Predecessor of famous memorie K. Henry the 8th.,
together w<b>h</b> diverse of y<b>r</b> Companie, w<b>h</b> being both like him and well
done Wee are desirous to have copyd.”<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c020'><b>[708]</b></a> Holbein’s name is not mentioned
in this letter. The copy then made is in all probability the one
now in the possession of the Royal College of Surgeons,<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c020'><b>[709]</b></a> which is smaller
than the original, and an indifferent version of it, on paper attached
to canvas. The figure of Alsop, on the extreme right of the King,
is omitted, and in place of the tablet with the inscription, the window
with a view of the church tower is shown, proving that even if it is
not the copy ordered by James I, it is at least a very early version of
the original. It was at one time in the collection of Desenfans, and
at his sale in 1786 was purchased by the Surgeons’ Company for fifty
guineas. It has been incorrectly described as the original cartoon
for the picture, and it has also been said, but this again is wrong, that
it belonged at one time to the Barber-Surgeons’ Company, and that
when the two branches of the Guild were finally separated in 1745, the
College retained the copy or cartoon and the Company kept the picture.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c020'><b>[710]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>The next reference to the picture occurs in Pepys’ <i>Diary</i>, under
the date August 29, 1668. The entry runs: “At noon, comes by
appointment Harris to dine with me; and after dinner, he and I to
Chirurgeons’ Hall, where they are building it new, very fine; and
there to see their theatre, which stood all the fire, and, which was
our business, their great picture of Holbein’s, thinking to have
bought it, by the help of Mr. Pierce, for a little money. I did think
to give 200<i>l.</i> for it, it being said to be worth 1000<i>l.</i>;
but it is so spoiled that I have no mind to it, and is not a pleasant
though a good picture.” The fire of which Pepys speaks was the great
fire of 1666, and the damage to which he refers may have been caused
to some extent by the smoke, though it is more probable that the
injury he noted was merely that caused by time and restoration. Wornum
suggests that it underwent restoration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>shortly after the Great Fire, and that the tablet with the inscription
was then introduced in place of the original window.<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c020'><b>[711]</b></a> The entry in
the <i>Diary</i> further shows how high a value the Company placed on the
picture even in those days, and also that they were prepared to sell
it at their own price.<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c020'><b>[712]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>In 1734 the Company commissioned Bernard Baron to engrave
the picture for the sum of 150 guineas. The plate, which is a large one,
and a fairly accurate transcript of the original, except that it is reversed,
was published in 1736. It was dedicated to the Earl of
Burlington, with a Latin inscription. In 1856 it was engraved on
wood for the <i>Illustrated London News</i> by Henry Linton.<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c020'><b>[713]</b></a> In 1895 the
Company were again anxious to sell it, and an effort was made to purchase
it for the nation, but unfortunately the scheme fell through,
possibly because the extravagant price of £15,000 was asked for it.</p>

<p class='c023'>While still engaged upon this important work, Holbein’s life was
cut short by the plague, which raged so severely in London in the
summer and autumn of 1543 that hundreds of people died each week
from it. According to Hall, “Thys yeare was in London a great
death of the Pestilence, and therefore Mighelmas Tearme was adjourned
to Saynt Albons”; and Stow repeats this statement almost
word for word.<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c020'><b>[714]</b></a> Holbein succumbed to it on some date between the
7th of October and 29th of November. This was proved by the discovery
of his will in February 1861, by Mr. W. H. Black, F.S.A., who
found it in one of the Registers of the Commissary of London, at that
time preserved in the Record Room at St. Paul’s Cathedral. It is
included in the book called “Beverly,” on folios 116 and 121, that
volume covering the period from 1539 to 1548. It runs as follows:</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>According to these entries, John of Antwerp was Holbein’s executor,
although he is not so mentioned in the will, and on the 29th November
he renounced all execution of it, and took out letters of administration
only. The will itself appears to have been drawn up carelessly and
in haste; probably Holbein was already sickening when he made it,
so that it had to be done in a hurry, or he may have been merely
alarmed, owing to the number of people daily dying around him,
including, as Mr. Lionel Cust points out,<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c020'><b>[716]</b></a> some members of John of
Antwerp’s own household, in whose dwelling, he suggests, Holbein may
himself have contracted the disease. The meaning of the two official
acts is not easy to follow, but the explanation given by Sir Augustus
W. Franks, F.S.A., procured from a legal source, is no doubt the correct
one. “Though the two official acts which follow the copy of the Will
may at first appear inconsistent both with the Will and also with each
other; yet, if we suppose that John Anwarpe was considered to have
been appointed executor by implication (which the law allowed), much
of the seeming inconsistency will disappear. The object of the renunciation
may have been either to obviate some doubt which existed as
to whether John Anwarpe was so made executor (for the language is
hardly strong enough), or to avoid certain liabilities that would have
affected him as executor, but not as administrator. Formerly a
person was said to have died intestate, not only when he left no Will,
but also when he left a Will and appointed no executor, or appointed
executors and they all renounced. In this administration act the
testator is accordingly said to have died intestate. The great difficulty
in these official acts is how John Anwarpe could have been executor
and Mr. Anthony not. The second of the two is almost a repetition
of the first, and both are dated on the same day.”<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c020'><b>[717]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S WILL</div>
<p class='c023'>The will is of great interest, not only as proving the date of Holbein’s
death within a week or two, but also as affording some information as
to his worldly position and his personal friends. Although his
practice in London was a large one, he died somewhat heavily in debt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and the inference is that he had not saved money. What his personal
possessions consisted of, the document, so hastily drawn, does not say,
but, unlike a number of his fellow-artists, he does not seem to have
owned any property in London. It does not necessarily follow, however,
that he was extravagant in his habits, though he kept a horse and owed
money. It has been assumed that the frequent payment of his salary
in advance was due to improvidence; but there is nothing beyond
the terms of his will to support this, or to show that he spent all his
income on himself, and that he failed to send money regularly to Basel
in support of his wife and family. The reference to his two children
at nurse indicates some irregular connection in England, which may
have been one of the reasons which made him disinclined to return
permanently to Basel in accordance with the wish of his fellow-townsmen.
Considering the laxity of morals at that period, the fact
that he had a second family in London is not very surprising. It has
been suggested that the mother of these children died of the plague
shortly before the artist, and that his will was made through anxiety
to provide for them should he in turn be taken with the rapid and
usually fatal disease, to which most victims succumbed within three
days. The amount bequeathed for these children’s maintenance,
about three half-pence a day each, does not seem much, but when the
relative value of money at that time is taken into consideration, it
was no doubt enough for their simple needs. What eventually became
of them is not known.</p>

<p class='c023'>With regard to the four witnesses to the will, all of whom were, no
doubt, personal friends of the painter, nothing is known with any
certainty except as regards John of Antwerp. The Mr. Anthony of
Greenwich, one of the King’s servants, to whom Holbein owed the
considerable amount of £10, 13<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, is evidently the
same individual who witnessed the will as Anthony Snecher, armourer,
although the words “before said” do not occur against his name as
witness as they do in the case of John of Antwerp. Both Mr. Black and
Sir A. Franks, however, appear to have regarded them as two distinct
persons.<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c020'><b>[718]</b></a> The former suggested that “Mr. Anthony” was Anthony
Anthony, one of the officers of the Ordnance Department, who had some
skill as an illuminator, if the embellishments of certain rolls
dealing with the navy and signed by him were from his hand, as is
probable. The latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>thought that Anthony Snecher was possibly one of the body of German
armourers in the regular employment of the King at Greenwich, of
whom Erasmus Kirkheimer was the chief, and that Holbein may have
supplied him with designs for the ornamentation of weapons. Mr. J.
Gough Nichols suggested that Mr. Anthony may have been Anthony
Toto, the painter, with whom Holbein must have been acquainted,
and with whom he may have worked in conjunction with other foreign
artists upon the decoration of Nonsuch Palace.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Of Olryck Obinger, the merchant, nothing is known, but from his
name he must have been a Swiss or German, possibly a merchant
of the Steelyard, though there is no reference to him in the State
Papers, which contain the names of a large number of the members
of that body. From his name, too, Harry Maynert, the painter,
also appears to have been a German or a Fleming. He remains an
indefinite figure at present.<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c020'><b>[719]</b></a> Mr. Black suggested that he might be
a relation of the John Maynard who was one of the painters employed
on the tomb of Henry VII. A relationship is also possible with the
Katherine Maynors, of Antwerp, a painter, who obtained letters of
denization in England in 1540, at which time she was a widow.</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f719'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r719'>719</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fine miniature by Holbein at Munich, bearing the
initials H. M., which Dr. Ganz suggests may be a portrait of Harry
Maynert, is described on pp. 241-2.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>THE PLACE OF HIS BURIAL</div>
<p class='c023'>The discovery of the will put an end to the tradition which had
existed from the beginning of the seventeenth century that Holbein
died in 1554. This mistake is to be traced back to the publication
of Carel van Mander’s <i>Het Schilder Boeck</i>, published in 1604, two years
before the writer’s death. In his account of Holbein he concludes by
saying: “Soo is Holbeen in groote benoutheydt te Londen ghestorven
van de Pest A<b>o</b> 1554, oudt 56 Jaren.” [Thus did Holbein die in London,
of the plague, in great distress, in the year 1554, fifty-six years old.
Succeeding writers copied from Van Mander. Joachim von Sandrart
repeated the statement in his <i>Teutsche Akademie</i>—“Wurde er 1554
im 56 Jahre seines Alters von der damals in Londen wütenden Pest
hingerafft”—and later biographers continued the error, which led to
great confusion, as it added eleven years to the painter’s life, and caused
almost all Tudor portraits bearing dates between 1544 and 1554
to be attributed to him. Wornum suggests that the letter from the
Burgomaster of Basel to Jacob David, the Parisian goldsmith, with
reference to Philip Holbein, which is dated 1545 and speaks of Holbein,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the father, as then deceased, may have been shown to Van Mander
or copied for him, and that in transcribing it, or even in the printing
of his book, the last two figures of the date were accidentally transferred,
so that 45 was turned into 54.<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c020'><b>[720]</b></a> Such mistakes are not of uncommon
occurrence, and this solution may be the true one. There was no
plague raging in London in 1554, while in 1543 there was an unusually
severe visitation. Otherwise Van Mander’s account of the painter’s
death is substantially correct. The place of his burial remains uncertain,
but according to tradition, as voiced by Strype, he was interred
in the church of St. Catherine Cree. Strype, in his additions to Stow’s
<i>Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster</i>,<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c020'><b>[721]</b></a> says: I have been told
that <i>Hans Holben</i>, the great and inimitable painter in King Henry
VIII’s Time, was buried in this Church; and that the Earl of <i>Arundel</i>,
the great Patron of Learning and Arts, would have set up a Monument
to his Memory here, had he but known whereabouts the Corps
lay.”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f720'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r720'>720</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wornum, p. 23.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r721'>721</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1720, Book II. p. 64.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The same story was told by Sandrart, without mentioning the
church. He supposed that the Earl’s difficulty arose from the fact
that so many people were dying daily, and had to be buried in such
haste, that Holbein probably shared a common grave with others,
and that no record would be kept. There can be little doubt that he
would be buried in or near the parish in which he was residing. The
church of St. Catherine Cree, though in the next parish, is not many
hundred yards distant from the Church of St. Andrew Undershaft,
and it is probable that Holbein was interred in one or the other of them,
possibly the latter, confusion as to the exact locality having arisen at
a later date owing to the close proximity of the two churches. Unfortunately
no registers of the time are available. St. Andrew Undershaft
escaped the Great Fire, but its register from 1538 to 1579 has
disappeared, while that of St. Catherine Cree begins only in 1663.</p>

<p class='c023'>Holbein’s wife and family are not mentioned in his will, and what
little is known of their further history is largely due to the researches
of Dr. His-Heusler in the Basel archives. His wife survived him for
six years, dying early in 1549, after a somewhat lengthy illness, as on
the 9th of July in the preceding year she appointed, for this reason, a
deputy to manage her affairs. It is to be gathered that she was left
by Holbein in a fairly comfortable position, what with the annual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>pension allowed her by the civic authorities, the two houses which her
husband had purchased fifteen years earlier, and the legacy from his
uncle Sigmund, which the painter does not appear to have touched.
Nor does it follow, because she was not mentioned in the will, that he
had failed to send to her at least a part of his English earnings. An
inventory taken on the 8th of March 1549, shortly after her death,
shows that she was fairly well provided with worldly goods. In
addition to furniture, an ample supply of linen, and the more ordinary
household utensils, she possessed two silver-gilt covered cups, six
silver goblets, a dozen silver-plated spoons, and a valise with a portion
of her deceased husband’s wardrobe, including a black cap, a Spanish
cape trimmed with velvet, a doublet of smoke-coloured Florentine
taffeta, and others of black satin, crimson silk, and black damask.
These garments must have been left behind by Holbein when he
visited Basel in 1538, rather than forwarded after his death by his
executor, who, according to the terms of the will, was obliged to sell
everything. His stepson, Franz Schmid, who carried on his father’s
tanning business, died before his mother, leaving two children.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN’S DESCENDANTS</div>
<p class='c023'>Some years after 1545, Holbein’s eldest son, Philip, having completed
his apprenticeship to Jacob David in Paris, from whose service
he only obtained release after the Basel Town Council had come to
his assistance, worked for a time as a goldsmith in Lisbon, and finally
settled in Augsburg, where he founded a diamond-cutting business.
He in turn had a son named Philip, who, in 1611, petitioned the Emperor
Matthias for a confirmation and augmentation of “his old and
noble coat of arms.” In this document, in which he describes himself
as Imperial court jeweller and a citizen of Augsburg, he speaks of his
grandfather Johann, as “the painter at that time celebrated throughout
Europe,” and asserts that the Holbeins were descended from a
noble family of the “city of Uri.” This last statement, however, was
largely imaginary, and had its sole foundation in the fact that the
Holbein arms<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c020'><b>[722]</b></a> were the same as those of the canton of Uri, with the
exception that the latter lacked the star between the bull’s horns.
This Philip Holbein, who, according to Von Mechel, had been living in
Vienna since 1600, had his petition granted on the 1st October in the
following year, 1612. In 1756 one of his descendants, Johann Georg
Holbein, who was connected with the Court of Chancery, obtained a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>confirmation of the noble rank granted to his family in 1612, with the
surname of Holbeinsberg, and in 1787 was raised to the rank of a Knight
of the Empire, with the title of a noble of Holbeinsberg.</p>

</div>

<p class='c023'>Holbein’s elder daughter, Katherine, married in 1545 a butcher
named Jacob Gyssler, a widower with a grown-up daughter. Among
the papers of Ludwig Iselin there is a list of all the deaths which occurred
in Basel between 1588 and 1612, from which we learn that she
died on February 8, 1590. She is described as Katharina Holbeinin,
daughter of the deceased Hans Holbein, the distinguished painter,
wife of a butcher. The second daughter, Küngolt, or Kunigunde,
after the death of her mother, married a miller named Andreas Syff.
They had a numerous family, and one of their granddaughters married
Friedrich Merian, brother of the well-known engraver, Matthaüs Merian.
Küngolt, according to Iselin’s list, died seven months after her
sister, on September 15, 1590. She is described in the same terms,
as the daughter of the celebrated artist. In this list there also occurs
the name of a third lady of the Holbein family, who died on the 17th
September 1594, but she is merely described as “Felicitas Holbein,
wife of Conrad Volmar, died of the plague,” and it is not certain that
she was one of the painter’s daughters. Nothing is known of the
younger son, Jacob Holbein, except that he also became a goldsmith,
and that he came to England and died in London in the summer of
1552. In 1549, at the time of his mother’s death, he was still a minor,
and the document in the Basel archives dealing with the division of
his property after his death is dated June 27, 1552. No other record
of his presence in London has been so far traced.</p>

<p class='c023'>The name occurs in England both before and after Hans Holbein’s
residence here, but in every case the bearers of it were almost certainly
Englishmen. Walpole mentions a Holbein, on the authority of an
entry in a register at Wells,<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c020'><b>[723]</b></a> as living in the reign of Henry VII, and
conjectures him to have been a foreigner, and even a relation of Hans,
and the possible author of some early paintings, including a portrait
of Henry VII. In this, however, he was wrong. His Holbein was
evidently an English country gentleman, and probably some relative
of a certain Johannes Holbyn of North Stoke, close to Bath, who died
in 1548, and left a sum of money to the Cathedral of Wells. The
wills of two other well-to-do persons of this name occur in the registry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of the Archidiaconal Court of Canterbury—that of John Holbein of
Folkestone, dated August 21, 1534, who bequeathed forty-six shillings
and eightpence for a new covered font for the parish church,
and of his widow, who died shortly after him, which is dated November
25, 1534, and was proved in the following January. These people
were all English, and had no connection with the painter.<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c020'><b>[724]</b></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Holbein founded no school of painting either in England or Switzerland,
and there is no evidence to show that he had any pupils. It is
probable that he employed assistants when engaged upon such wall-paintings
as those he carried out in Whitehall, but whoever they may
have been, their engagement was only a temporary one. As already
noted, there is no record, as there is in the case of several other foreign
artists then resident in this country, of a royal warrant according
him the privilege of employing in regular service a number of alien
assistants or servants in spite of the Act which made such a proceeding
illegal. No pupil of his is mentioned by any of his early biographers,
and it seems almost certain that no one directly studied under him.
If there had been such a painter, some record of him is almost certain to
have survived. There are a number of portraits, as a rule of no very
great artistic merit, in various private collections in England, which
were evidently painted indirectly under his influence. Such examples
are to be expected, for it was impossible for so great a master to be at
work in London for so many years without a certain number of imitators
springing up, who attempted to work in his methods and to copy
his style. It is hardly possible now that even the names of these
third-rate imitators and ineffectual rivals will be unearthed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>GUILLIM STRETES</div>
<p class='c023'>As already stated, prior to the discovery of his will almost all paintings
bearing dates between 1543 and 1554 were ascribed to him; even
to-day, in some instances, the owners, in spite of the impossibility,
still adhere to the great name, as the catalogues of most of the exhibitions
held within recent years dealing with the Tudor period afford
proof. The authorship of these pictures must be sought for elsewhere,
though in many cases the task is one of extreme difficulty. Several
painters of considerable talent were at work at the English court
during the years immediately following Holbein’s death, and in some
instances signed and authenticated works by them exist which enable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>comparisons to be made and certain unsigned works from their hands
to be identified with some confidence. Such men as these were Johannes
Corvus and Gerlach Fliccius; but in other cases, such as that of
Guillim Stretes, only the names and a few scanty records remain, and
it is impossible to point to any picture which can be said with absolute
certainty to have been produced by them. Lucas Hornebolt died in
1544, about six months later than Holbein, and in the same year
Girolamo da Treviso was killed by a cannon-ball at the siege of Boulogne.
Several of the leading Italian artists, however, continued to
serve the court during the remainder of Henry VIII’s life and throughout
the succeeding reign, such as Antonio Toto, the sergeant-painter,
his colleague, Bartolommeo Penni, and Nicolas Bellin of Modena,
though no signed or authenticated picture by any one of them has
survived.</p>

<p class='c023'>One of the most important of Holbein’s immediate successors was
the Dutch painter, Guillim or Gillam Stretes, though so far no mention
of him has been found prior to the accession of Edward VI.
Strype’s extract from the records of the Privy Council, having reference
to a payment of fifty marks made to him for two pictures of
the young King and one of the Earl of Surrey, has been already
quoted,<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c020'><b>[725]</b></a> as well as the fact that in 1553 he was receiving, as King’s
painter, an annuity of £62, 10<i>s.</i>, more than double Holbein’s salary,
showing that he was a person of importance among the painters of
Edward’s reign. Reference has also been made to the attribution to
Stretes of the full-length portrait of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey,
in the collection of the Duke of Norfolk at Arundel Castle,<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c020'><b>[726]</b></a> and of the
duplicate version, without the painted framework, at Knole.<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c020'><b>[727]</b></a> The
attribution of these two works to Stretes is based entirely on the
Privy Council order. Dr. Waagen<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c020'><b>[728]</b></a> stated that the Arundel Castle
portrait was inscribed “William Strote,” but no one else has succeeded
in discovering this signature, and very possibly the name he quotes
was seen by him on some old label then attached to the frame and
since removed. These two portraits, as already noted, have been
grouped with several other full-lengths, including the young man in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>red at Hampton Court Palace (No. 345 (315)), wrongly described as a
portrait of the Earl of Surrey,<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c020'><b>[729]</b></a> that of Sir Thomas Gresham, dated
1544, in Mercers’ Hall, the beautiful portrait of William West, Lord
Delawarr,<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c020'><b>[730]</b></a> belonging to Lieut.-Col. G. L. Holford, C.I.E., C.V.O.,
and the one of the Earl of Southampton, 1542, in the Fitzwilliam
Museum.<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c020'><b>[731]</b></a> These portraits display somewhat close affinities, though
it is not possible to allow that all are by the same hand. The portrait
of William West is a work of great power and character, and has been
attributed to Holbein himself, but the style of the painting does not
accord with his. All these works are of considerably earlier date
than that of the Privy Council order, which is the earliest reference
so far discovered touching this painter, and it is extremely doubtful
whether he had anything to do with them. One is on safer ground
in attributing to him some of the portraits of King Edward, which
exist in considerable numbers, two of which he certainly painted,
and very possibly others. These portraits of the young King, and
Stretes’ probable connection with them, have been dealt with in an
earlier chapter.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c020'><b>[732]</b></a> One other picture Stretes is known to have painted,
for it is recorded that on New Year’s Day, 1556, he presented Queen
Mary with “a table of her Majesty’s Marriage.”<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c020'><b>[733]</b></a> This picture,
which must have been one of particular interest, has completely disappeared.
Dr. Williamson records a signed miniature by him of
Edward VI, almost full-face, wearing a jewelled cap, in Earl Beauchamp’s
collection at Madresfield Court,<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c020'><b>[734]</b></a> and he also attributes to
the same painter a second miniature of the young King, as a little boy,
in the Rijks Museum, Amsterdam.<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c020'><b>[735]</b></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>GERLACH FLICCIUS</div>
<p class='c023'>Of Johannes Corvus, the Fleming, and his portraits of Richard
Foxe, Bishop of Winchester, and of Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII,
the one undated, and the other of the year 1532, some account has
been already given.<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c020'><b>[736]</b></a> Little is known of this painter, or of Gerlach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Fliccius or Flicke, who, like Holbein, was German, and appears to
have settled in London towards the end of Henry VIII’s reign, where
he died in 1558. Recent researches by Miss Mary Hervey<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c020'><b>[737]</b></a> have,
however, added considerably to our knowledge of this painter and his
work. His will, recently discovered, which is dated 24th January
1558, and was proved by his widow on the 11th February following,
shows that he was living in the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate,
and that he possessed lands and goods in Osnabrüch, of which
place he was no doubt a native. In this document he calls himself
“Drawer,” and gives his name as Garlick Flicke, and it was under the
name of Garlick that he was generally known in this country. The
Lumley inventory includes three portraits by him—a full-length,
described as “The Statuary of Thomas first Lo: Darcy of Chiche,
created by King Edw. 6. L<b>d</b> Chamberlayne to the said K. Edw.:
drawn by Garlicke,” and two small ones of “Queen Marye, drawne
by Garlicke,” and “Thomas, the third Duke of Northfolke, drawne
by Garlicke.” Unfortunately these three portraits have disappeared—the
full-length of Lord Darcy in quite modern times. Until 1854 it
was hanging in Irnham Hall, Lincolnshire, but in that year the house
and its contents were sold, and the present whereabouts of the picture
has so far not been traced. Miss Hervey gives a list of eight portraits
which can be attributed with more or less certainty to Fliccius. In
addition to the three from the Lumley Collection, there are three
others in the collection of the Marquis of Lothian at Newbattle Abbey,
Dalkeith, the portrait of Archbishop Cranmer in the National Portrait
Gallery, and the small double portrait of the painter himself and his
friend, Richard Strangeways. The three at Newbattle Abbey<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c020'><b>[738]</b></a> are
of great interest, though it is impossible to describe them in detail
here. The finest, which is dated 1547, and is signed “Gerlacius
Fliccūs Germanūs faciebat,” represents an unknown man of the age
of forty, whom Miss Hervey tentatively suggests to be William, Lord
Grey of Wilton, clad in a slit buff jerkin and a black velvet surcoat
trimmed with fur. It is a portrait of considerable power, and though
it has suffered from repainting still appears to have been the work of a
man of more than ordinary artistic talents. The second portrait at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Newbattle—of Sir Peter Carew—has many points in common with it,
and was probably painted at about the same time. The portrait of
Archbishop Cranmer in the National Portrait Gallery is stiffer in style
than these, and suggests a more obvious attempt to follow the manner
of Holbein, but though very carefully painted and with every appearance
of truth of portraiture, lacks the vitality which stamps everything
from the hand of the master. It is signed “Gerbicus Flicciis Germanus
faciebat,” and though undated was, according to the sitter’s
age, painted in 1545. The curious double portrait, on a small oak panel,
of Flicke and his friend Strangeways or Strangwish, the gentleman
privateer, known as the “Red Rover,” was painted in prison in 1554.
The artist seems to have been mixed up in Wyat’s rebellion, and as a
result he and his friend were imprisoned, but afterwards released.
Over each head is painted a verse, that above Flicke’s in Latin, which,
translated, runs: “Such in appearance was Gerlach Fliccius, what
time he was a painter in the City of London. This portrait he painted
from a mirror for his dear friends, that they might be able to remember
him after his death.” The lines over Strangeways are in English:</p>

<p class='c022'>The background is blue. The present ownership of this picture is
unknown. The remaining picture, at Newbattle Abbey, is a small
portrait of Jacques de Savoie, duc de Nemours, showing the head and
shoulders only of a young man with fair hair and a very slight beard and
moustache, in French dress, and wearing the Order of St. Michael. It
betrays the influence of the French school, and is in style of marked
difference to his other known works. It was identified in 1909 by
M. Dimier, who discovered three crayon drawings taken from it, all of
them bearing the title given above. The original picture is signed
“G. Fliccus ft.,” and on the back is an old label with “Origl. Fliccus

<div class='sidenote'>HANS EWORTHE OR EEUWOUTS</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Recent researches on the part of Mr. Lionel Cust have established
the identity of another foreign painter of considerable skill,
who was at work in England some years after Holbein’s death, but
who hitherto has been known only under the initials H. E.<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c020'><b>[740]</b></a> This
monogram occurs on a number of pictures of important personages
bearing dates from 1550 to 1568, the earliest of them being on a portrait
at Longford Castle, formerly known as Sir Anthony Denny, but now
recognised as Sir Thomas Wyndham. These portraits have usually
been given to Lucas d’Heere,<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c020'><b>[741]</b></a> of Ghent, although all that is known of
that painter’s life, including the fact that he did not come to England
before 1568, made the attribution of any one of them to him one of
great difficulty. Mr. Cust, by means of certain entries in the Lumley
inventory, has proved that the real author of them was a certain Jan
Eeuwouts, of Antwerp, whose name became anglicised into Haunce
or Hans Eworthe. Three of the Lumley portraits are described as
the work of Eworthe—“Mr. Edw. Shelley slayne at Mustleborough
fielde, drawen by Haunce Eworthe”; “Haward a Dutch Juello<b>r</b>,
drawne for a Maisters prize by his brother, Haunce Eworthe”; and
“Mary Duches of Northfolke, daughter to the last Earle of Arundell
Fitzallan, doone by Haunce Eworthe,” the last one being in all probability
the portrait now at Arundel Castle, which is signed H. E. in
monogram. Several other portraits in the Lumley inventory, though
no painter’s name is given, still exist, and bear this monogram, such as
the small double portrait of Lord Darnley and his brother, Charles
Stewart, at Windsor Castle; Lord Maltravers at Arundel Castle;
Sir John Lutterel, dated 1550, at Dunster Castle; and Sir Thomas
Wyndham, also dated 1550, at Longford Castle.<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c020'><b>[742]</b></a> These portraits
prove that Eworthe was much employed by Lord Lumley or his father-in-law,
the last Earl of Arundel, at Nonsuch Palace. Mr. Cust has
traced him as a resident alien in London in 1552 in the parish of
St. Saviour’s, Southwark. He is described in the return as “John
Ewottes, paynter,” and assessed at the high rate of eight guineas, and
he employed a servant named John Mychell, who was assessed at
eightpence. As “Jan Eeuwouts, schilder,” he was admitted a free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>master of the Guild of St. Luke in Antwerp in 1540. It is thus possible

<p class='c023'>The present writer ventures to suggest that Eworthe was also the

of Walpole’s also suggests a possible connection with Eworthe:
“Another picture of Edward VI was in the collection of Charles I,

<div class='sidenote'>THOMAS AND JOHN BETTES</div>
<p class='c023'>It is impossible to mention more than the names of certain better-known
foreigners who practised in England under Mary and Elizabeth,
such as Mor, who came over in 1553, Joos van Cleve, who did so in
1554, and Lucas d’Heere. Of the few known native painters working
in London in the years immediately following Holbein’s death the
records are so scanty that little remains but their names, but, taking
them as a body, they must have been men of very modest talent,
and in portraiture, when they essayed it, merely feeble imitators either
of Holbein or one of the other leading foreigners at Henry’s court.
Among them were John Shute, painter and architect, and John Bettes,
both of whom are described as miniature painters by Richard Haydock
in his translation of <i>Lomazzo on Painting</i> (1598), and, apparently, as
contemporaries of Nicholas Hilliard. “Limnings,” he says, “much
used in former times in church-books, as also in drawing by the life
in small models, of late years by some of our countrymen, as <i>Shoote</i>,
<i>Betts</i>, &amp;c., but brought to the rare perfection we now see by the most
ingenious, painful, and skilful master, Nicholas Hilliard.”<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c020'><b>[747]</b></a> Meres,
in <i>Palladis Tamia, Wits Treasury</i>, the second part of his <i>Wits Commonwealth</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>also published in 1598, in giving a list of the leading painters
in England at that time, mentions “Thomas and John Bettes.” From
these two entries it seems clear that Bettes was an Elizabethan miniature
painter, and Vertue, who was of opinion that he learned from
Hilliard, mentions a miniature by him of Holbein’s sitter, Sir John
Godsalve, in which he was represented with his spear and shield, with
the inscription “Captum in castris ad Boloniam 1540.”<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c020'><b>[748]</b></a> There is,
however, in the National Gallery a small portrait of Edmund Butts
(No. 1496), a son of Sir William Butts, another of Holbein’s sitters,
to which reference has been already made,<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c020'><b>[749]</b></a> which is attributed to
John Bettes, and bears the date 1545. If this attribution, based
on a French inscription on the back of the panel, be correct, the
date indicates that the painter was at work at a considerably earlier
period than is to be inferred from the only two almost contemporary
references to him, quoted above, which have been so far discovered,
and that he may even have been personally acquainted with Holbein.
The portrait in the National Gallery is a work of considerable merit,
and possesses certain Holbeinesque characteristics. In any case,
the date upon it makes it impossible, if painted by Bettes, that he
could have been Hilliard’s pupil, as Vertue asserted. Little or
nothing is known of his work, though, according to Dr. Williamson,
there is a fine miniature of an unknown man by him in the Montagu
House Collection, signed “J. B. 1580”;<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c020'><b>[750]</b></a> and a second, of a somewhat
earlier date, a portrait of Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France,
apparently unsigned, in Lord Beauchamp’s possession at Madresfield
Court.<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c020'><b>[751]</b></a> Dr. Williamson also notes a quaint miniature of Edward
VI as a baby in the Rijks Museum, Amsterdam, which in an old
inventory of the Dutch royal possessions is attributed to Bettes.<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c020'><b>[752]</b></a>
Fox, in his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, states that John Bettes drew the
vignettes for Hall’s <i>Chronicle</i>. Still less is known of Thomas Bettes,
but there was a miniature in the Propert Collection of John Digby,
Earl of Bristol, which was given to him.</p>

<p class='c023'>Another painter, of whom little is known but his name, was Nicholas
Lyzarde, who is generally considered to have been an Englishman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>though Mr. Digby Wyatt speaks of him as Nicolo Lizardi.<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c020'><b>[753]</b></a> He was
employed about the Court during the last years of Henry VIII’s reign.
Thus, in 1543-4 he was at the head of a band of painters engaged on
work in connection with some revels at Hampton Court, for which he
received higher wages than the others—“Wages to painters: Nich<b>s</b>
Lezard 18<i><b>d</b></i> per diem”; and in 1544-5 he supplied various materials
and properties for some other masque—“Paste work and painting,
Nicholas Lizarde, painter, for gyldinge under garments for women,
of white and blue sarcenet, with party gold and silver, 4 <i>li.</i>; 8 pastes
for women, 20<i>d.</i>; 8 long heads for women, made of past gilded, with
party gold and silver, 43<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>” &amp;c. He was afterwards in the
regular employment of the Court throughout the reigns of Edward VI,
Mary, and Elizabeth, being serjeant-painter to the last-named Queen,
with a pension or salary of £10 a year. Nothing of his work
remains that can be identified, but that he painted “subject”
pictures is to be gathered from a New Year’s gift he presented to
Queen Mary in 1556 of a “table painted with the Maundy,” while in
1558 his gift to Queen Elizabeth was “a table painted of the history
of Assuerus,” for which he received a gilt cruse of some 8 oz. in
weight. He died in April 1571, and at the time was living in the
parish of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, and left a family of five sons and
four daughters.<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c020'><b>[754]</b></a></p>

Inst. Brit. Architects</i>, 1868, pp. 218 and 235. It may be suggested
that this painter was the “Master Nycolas” or “Nicholas Florentine”
who worked with Holbein on the decorations of the Greenwich Banqueting
Hall in 1527; while a possible, though not very probable, connection
between Nicholas Lyzarde and Nicholas Lasora, who was engaged upon
similar work at Westminster Palace in 1532, has been already pointed
out. Lasora, however, in spite of his Italian-sounding name, appears
to have been a Teuton, for he may be identified with some probability
as the “Nic. Leysure, a German,” mentioned more than once in the royal
accounts. See vol. i. p. 314 and note.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HIS IMITATORS AND COPYISTS</div>
<p class='c023'>In the wider field of European art, also, it is impossible to point
to any painter who was a pupil, or even a direct follower, of the master.
Sandrart says that Christopher Amberger “followed the famous artist
Holbein in his manner of painting, and especially in portraiture,” but
modern criticism does not endorse this statement. In any case, his
opportunities of studying Holbein’s works must have been few, though
Woltmann considered that he certainly did so, and regarded him, if
not as an actual pupil, yet as a real follower of the master.<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c020'><b>[755]</b></a> It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>to be expected, indeed, that Holbein should have formed any definite
school, though he must have influenced painting in Basel during his
first and longest residence in that city; but, except for that period,
his life was more or less a wandering one, and he never, during his short
career, settled for a long enough time in any one place to have allowed
him to gather any considerable body of pupils around him.<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c020'><b>[756]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f756'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r756'>756</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On this point, however, see Elsa Frölicher, <i>Die
Porträtkunst Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren und ihr Einfluss auf die
schweizerische Bildnismalerei im XVI Jahrhundert</i>, 1909, in which
she traces the influence of Holbein’s art on a number of contemporary
Swiss painters and others practising in the latter half of the
sixteenth century, such as Hans Asper, Tobias Stimmer, Kluber,
Clauser, and Hans Bock the Elder.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The work of his imitators and copyists, such as they were, is to be
found in the portraits scattered about the older country houses and
mansions of England, where they are usually attributed to Holbein
himself, often when the date upon them makes it impossible that he
could have painted them. Among them are numerous old copies of
still-existing portraits by him, which indicate the estimation in which
his work was held for years after his death. For instance, in the fire
which burnt down Knepp Castle, Sussex, in January 1904, a number
of pictures were destroyed, including no less than eight attributed to
Holbein. The titles of nearly all of them were familiar enough—Sir
Henry and Lady Guldeford, Anne of Cleves, Thomas Cromwell, Sir
Richard Rich, and Ægidius—indicating that they were most probably
merely replicas or copies. It is true that Holbein occasionally painted
a replica, but this was very rarely, and in most cases the portraits in
question were the work of far less skilful men, and owed their existence
to the desire of the descendants of Holbein’s original sitters to possess
copies of the older family portraits.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
HOLBEIN’S art was many-sided, but, through the cruel
caprice of Fate, he is known to-day to most people
merely as a great portrait-painter, and, in a lesser
degree, as a designer of woodcut illustrations of remarkable
power and imagination. It is true, of course,
that during the latter part of his life, after he had settled
more or less permanently in England, his time was almost entirely
occupied with portraiture, and that, beyond portraits, little or nothing
of his work remains in this country upon which to form a judgment
of the versatility of his genius; and it is true also that his stupendous
gifts in this field of art were bound to find free expression. That
portrait-painting, however, became in the end his chief occupation
was due much more to his environment than to his own personal
choice. There was little demand in this country for any other form
of art, and the painter, as was only natural, supplied what his patrons
asked of him. It is not to be supposed that the master who was capable
of producing such great works as the “Meyer Madonna,” or the various
altar-pieces and glass designs illustrating the “Passion,” would have
abandoned painting such compositions had he received any encouragement
to continue; but such encouragement came to a more or less
abrupt conclusion during the stormy days of the Reformation in Basel,
and for the remainder of his life Holbein produced little or nothing in
the field of sacred art. The few examples of this nature from his
brush which remain place him in the front rank of sixteenth-century
painters, and had his birthplace been south instead of north of the
Alps, and his life spent amid surroundings more sympathetic to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>side of his genius, there can be little doubt that he would have given
to the world a series of sacred works as fine as those of any of the great
Italians of the Renaissance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>DISAPPEARANCE OF DECORATIVE WORKS</div>
<p class='c023'>It is with respect to those larger decorative works, however, upon
which he was engaged from time to time throughout his life, both in
Switzerland and England—works for which in his own day he was so
justly celebrated—that Fate has treated him most unkindly. The total
disappearance of his great wall-paintings and monumental decorations
is not only an immense loss to art, but has rendered it difficult for all
but close students of his work to appreciate to the fullest extent the
wide range of his artistic powers. Not a single example of his skill as
a mural decorator remains. The passage of time, the carelessness of
those whose duty it was to preserve them, and the ravages of fire
and of the weather, gradually obliterated these paintings, while such
of their faded glories as endured until more modern days were
finally swept away by the clumsy hand of the restorer or the building
schemes of private owners and civic authorities. Just as it seems
practically certain that some at least of his sacred pictures were destroyed
by the fury of the rioters in the religious disturbances which
finally drove Holbein to Henry’s court, so the mural paintings and
pictured stories with which he covered the outer and inner walls of
a number of houses in Basel and Lucerne have vanished through
causes which, though different, have been equally effective in their
powers of destruction. Damp, dirt, and neglect brought about the
gradual fading away of his great series of wall-paintings in the Council
Chamber of the Basel Town Hall; while similar works of his English
period, the wonderful “Triumphs” painted for the banquet-hall of
the German Steelyard, and the great fresco of Henry VIII with his
parents and Jane Seymour in Whitehall, have disappeared, the former
on the final breaking up of the German trade monopoly in this country,
and the dispersal of the contents of the Steelyard buildings, and the
latter in the fire of 1698. Gone, too, is the large canvas of “The Battle
of Spurs,” painted for the festivities at Greenwich in 1527, one of
the first of Holbein’s important undertakings in England. No trace
of this painting now remains, and a similar fate has befallen the
great picture of Sir Thomas More and his family, though in this case
it is not absolutely certain that Holbein himself ever completed it.
Finally, death cut him down as he was engaged upon the most elaborate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>portrait group he ever undertook, which was not half finished
when he fell a victim to the plague. This list of lost or ruined masterpieces
is a long one. Unfortunately, the tale is by no means uncommon
in the history of art, but Holbein has suffered in this way more severely
than most. Of their beauty and their imaginative power it is now only
possible to judge from a few fragments of some of the original frescoes,
some inferior copies of certain of them, and a number of masterly
sketches and preliminary studies from Holbein’s own hand preserved
in the Basel Gallery, the British Museum, the Louvre, and elsewhere.
These latter, scanty as they are, remain priceless treasures, for only
by means of them is it possible to gain some idea, though it is a pale
reflection at the best, of the greatness of Holbein’s achievement in the
higher branches of art, the loftiness of his ideals in his monumental
paintings, and the wide range of his genius.</p>

<p class='c023'>In all these large decorative works Holbein displayed the greatest
fertility of invention, and a power of dramatic composition of a very
high order. The extraordinary energy of conception, the sense of
life and movement in all his figures, the truth and expressiveness of
their gestures, are all alike admirable. This dramatic power is at its
finest in his wall-paintings for the Basel Town Hall—the “Rehoboam”
and the “Samuel and Saul”; while in dignity and grandeur of composition,
and the noble rhythm of its stately movement, the “Triumph
of Riches” panel for the Steelyard is unsurpassed. The extraordinary
fertility and exuberance of his imagination is to be seen in the architectural
details and decorative settings in which these mural paintings
and designs were placed. These settings show how quickly and completely
he made the new ideas and decorative motives of the Renaissance
his own, while the pictures themselves, for which they formed
the background and the frame, breathe the lofty spirit of Raphael
and Mantegna. Though there is no slavish copying of the art and
architecture of Northern Italy, their influence is to be seen so plainly
in the work of his younger days that, as pointed out in earlier chapters,
at least a short visit to Lombardy on his part seems to have been
absolutely certain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HIS FERTILE IMAGINATION</div>
<p class='c023'>The same qualities and the same influences are to be discerned in his
designs for painted windows and the decoration of books; though
smaller in scale, they are conceived with an equal grandeur and dramatic
intensity. Indeed, in his “Dance of Death” woodcuts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>illustrations to the Old Testament his imaginative and dramatic powers
reached their highest manifestation. Minute as they are in execution,
they produce the same effects of largeness and dignity of composition
as his great wall-paintings must have done. In the “Dance of Death”
in particular the wideness of Holbein’s range of vision, the greatness
of his style in design, and the intense vitality of his art are seen to
the best advantage. These little pictures, a few inches square, express
within their borders almost the whole range of the emotions,
from the tender sympathy of the lovely “Death and the Ploughman,”
and the poignant grief of “Death and the Little Child,” down
to the terror, horror, and violence which is encountered in others of
the series in which Death suits his coming to the character of his
victims. Such works as these show the greatness of Holbein as an
imaginative artist. Another side of his nature and his art appears in
such a design as his “Peasants’ Dance” on the façade of the Haus
zum Tanz in Basel, in which the Teutonic element in his character
finds full play. The boisterous, even brutal, merriment of these fellow-countrymen
of his, as they fling themselves into the pleasures of the
dance with the utmost abandon, made an undoubted appeal to him,
and in depicting them he expressed the joy of living which animates
every movement with the utmost frankness and realism.</p>

<p class='c023'>In this wide field of mural decoration and historical painting
Holbein was the first and the greatest of those painters north of the
Alps who came under the influence of the Italian revival of art. In
him the Renaissance found very complete expression. This is also to
be seen in his innumerable designs for jewellery and the smaller decorative
arts, of which, happily, there still remain many examples.
Both in book ornamentations and illustrations, in work for the goldsmith
and silversmith, the jeweller, and the maker of stained and coloured
glass, he showed himself to be in closest sympathy with the new
movement. In his earlier works the effect of this influence appears
in the exuberant use he made of the models which he had recently
studied, some of the glass designs being overloaded with fantastic
reminiscences of the details of Lombardic architecture. Later on,
when he had completely grasped the full beauty of the Renaissance
forms, his taste became purer, and he adapted them to his uses with
the happiest results. In his drawings for personal ornaments and
jewellery, most of the best of which were done in London, the earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>exuberance is restrained, and the design is of the purest Renaissance
taste, in the practice of which he became an absolute master. These
working drawings show infinite invention kept within the true limitations
of the materials to be used, frequently combined with very
skilful adaptation of the human figure to decorative purposes. It
would be difficult to find a more beautiful design in the Renaissance
style than the one of the so-called Jane Seymour Cup, in which
Holbein more than holds his own with the best Italian workers in this
field.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>BRILLIANCE OF HIS DRAUGHTSMANSHIP</div>
<p class='c023'>His sacred paintings, in so far as can be judged from those which
remain, most, if not all, of which were done before he had reached the
age of thirty, possess similar qualities to those of his mural and
historical works, and had he but received some little encouragement
from the English court, he was capable of producing even finer
masterpieces than the “Meyer Madonna” during the seventeen or eighteen
remaining years of his life. In his “Passion” and kindred pictures the
composition is usually admirable, and the subject treated with that
strong dramatic sense which has been noted already as one of the chief
characteristics of his frescoes, while in depth and earnestness of
feeling they fall but little short of the work of the greatest of the
Italians. In the Meyer and the Solothurn Madonnas there is an air of
divine tranquillity, and a loftiness and purity in
the expression of spiritual beauty, which are combined in the happiest
and most exquisite way with remarkable truth to nature, and vividness
of accurate and sympathetic portraiture in the figures both of the
Virgin and the Divine Child, and those, in the one case, of the
kneeling donor and his family, and, in the other, of the attendant
saints. Added to these qualities, the rich, subdued, and harmonious
colour gives a still greater truth and beauty to the whole. In the
panel at Darmstadt, indeed, the painter has reached the full
perfection of his art, and that he painted nothing more of this nature
must always be a source of deep regret to all who admire him.</p>

<p class='c023'>In portraiture Holbein’s genius reached its highest manifestations.
This gift was largely inherited from his father, but was carried to a
much greater pitch of excellence by the son. His technical methods,
too, were those of his father, and here again were developed by him
to a far greater refinement of touch and skill in modelling; and to
these methods he remained constant throughout his life. There is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>striking contrast between the rapidity and brilliance of the draughtsmanship
of the preliminary studies for his portraits and the patient,
concentrated, minute, and delicate brush-work of the finished portraits
themselves. In all his completed work he spared himself no pains
in the painting of the accessories and details, though in none of it,
brilliant and absolutely truthful as it is, is there any sense of mere display,
any boastful attempt to show the world how clever he was. He
painted all such details with a loving care and an evident delight in
their beauty, and wrought them with a perfection and fidelity which
has rarely if ever been surpassed. This finish is carried in some of his
pictures to a point beyond which no Dutchman or Fleming of his own
or succeeding generations ever reached. Yet the elaboration of subordinate
things is never overdone; his portraits are never overcrowded
with details of this nature in a way to draw the spectator’s attention
from the main purpose of the work. This manipulative skill delights
and attracts, but is forgotten when the portrait itself is examined.
Without any apparent effort on the part of the painter, the sitter looks
out from the panel just as he did in life, set down without flattery, with
no harsh features softened, and with his character, seized with such
penetrative and imaginative power by Holbein, fixed for ever with unerring
truth and errorless draughtsmanship for succeeding generations
to see and to admire. This effect of absolute truth of portraiture and
revelation of character, the one due to the wonderful delicacy, subtlety,
and expressiveness of his line, and the other to his sympathetic insight,
is obtained by what appear to be the simplest and most straightforward
methods. There is a dignity and reticence about the portraits which
is admirable. Without thought of self, he occupies himself entirely
with the truth as he sees it, and with his desire to realise it as completely
as possible; no brilliance of technical skill mars the self-restraint
with which he approaches his sitter. He puts little of himself into his
portraits, and leaves out little that is worth knowing about the subjects
of them. No great subtleties of light and shade are attempted,
and his colour, beautiful and true as it is, helps but does not overpower
his chief purpose—the complete realisation of the man both
in body and soul. Holbein was a painter whose keenness of observation
was extraordinary; he missed little or nothing, and saw much
that lesser painters would have ignored. With his smooth, fusing
methods of painting he reached to most marvellously delicate and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>accurate modelling of form, which in its expressiveness is beyond
all words.<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c020'><b>[757]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f757'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r757'>757</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The writer finds it impossible to agree with a recent
critic, M. de Wyzewa, who, in a review of Dr. Ganz’s <i>Holbein</i>,
in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, January 15, 1912, speaks of the
“half-confidences” of Holbein’s portraiture, and holds that although
the painter himself sees clearly the inmost depths of his sitters’
characters, he yet refrains from revealing them to us. When the moment
comes for laying bare their deepest feelings “the prudent Swabian
workman, through his instinctive reserve, holds back.” In this
respect, therefore, he compares him unfavourably with such masters as
Dürer, Rembrandt, and Velazquez, “who abandon themselves to their
genius for psychological divination,” whereas Holbein refuses us
access to the souls of his sitters, though at the same time indicating
that he himself has penetrated to the mysterious depths. He speaks of
this as his “professional hypocrisy,” and says that he cannot be
excused for thus concealing the exact truth of the characters of the
great personages who sat to him. He sees similar traits in Holbein’s
sacred paintings, and this insensibility he regards as not real, but
feigned, springing from the intelligence rather than from the heart.
Lovers of Holbein’s art, however, will find it difficult to follow him
in his contention.</p>
</div>

<p class='c023'>As a draughtsman pure and simple he stands among the very
highest; in some of the qualities of his line he has never been surpassed
or even equalled. In the Windsor and kindred drawings, preliminary
studies for his portraits, his genius finds its most perfect expression,
and these are, in many ways, the greatest of his works. Slight as
most of them are, they contain all the elements of great art. Every
fine quality, except colour, that is to be found in his finished portraiture
is to be found here also, and more plainly to be seen, and produced
without apparent effort or hesitation. The swiftness yet sureness
of his touch, the wonderful delicacy yet strength of his supple, forceful
line, its subtlety and flexibility, the penetrative insight, the freedom
from all traces of mannerism, and the perfect unity of brain, eye, and
hand shown in these drawings, combine to produce the most vivid
effect of truthful, living portraiture. His complete mastership is
revealed in every touch.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN AND DÜRER</div>
<p class='c023'>In the German school of painting Dürer was the last and the greatest
of the mediævalists; Holbein was the first and the greatest of those
who came completely under the sway of the new influences in art and life
which reached Germany from beyond the Alps. The art of these two
great masters is, in consequence, in many ways so divergent that it is
difficult to make any comparison between them. Holbein was the
first of the painters of northern Europe who was modern in the sense
of the term as we understand it to-day. Dürer was steeped in the
spirit of the older schools, both of thought and of art, a dreamer of
dreams, a weaver of fantasies, and much of his work had a spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>passion which Holbein’s lacked, while his art was imbued through and
through with the feeling of the Middle Ages. On the other hand,
one of the characteristic features of Holbein’s work was its serenity
and saneness. As already pointed out, he had great imaginative
power, which he could use at times with dramatic intensity. Realism
in his painting reached a very high and at the same time a very noble
development. His delight in nature is evident in all that he did;
he observed her minutely, and took the utmost pleasure in reproducing
her manifold beauties down to the smallest details, while his work was
filled with a frank delight in life and close sympathy with all things,
animate and inanimate, in the world around him. Philosophical
thought or theological subtleties left him untroubled. That he was
on the side of the Reformation is made clear by more than one of his
woodcut designs, but his share in the controversy was after all a minor
one, and marked by little or none of that passion which swayed the
more eager partisans on either side.</p>

<p class='c023'>True child of the Renaissance as Holbein was, he was yet one of
the most original of artists. His strong individuality stamped everything
that he touched; for though the influences under which he was
trained can be traced throughout his career, they in no way dominated
his genius, which found its own true expression. Circumstances
combined to give this originality the fullest play. Both in Basel and
in London there was no school of painting worthy of the name,
and the artists who worked there had little or nothing to teach him.
In both these cities it was he who was the master who towered
head and shoulders above his fellow-painters. In this way his art
developed upon personal and original lines until it attained that
greatness of style which is so marked a feature of everything that
he touched.</p>

<p class='c023'>The art and character of these two great masters of the German
school is very happily contrasted by the late Lord Leighton in one of
his published addresses to the students of the Royal Academy. “Albert
Dürer,” he says, “may be regarded as <i>par excellence</i> the typical German
artist—far more so than his great contemporary, Holbein. He was
a man of a strong and upright nature, bent on pure and high ideals,
a man ever seeking, if I may use his own characteristic expression, to
make known through his work the mysterious treasure that was laid
up in his heart; he was a thinker, a theorist, and, as you know, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>writer; like many of the great artists of the Renaissance, he was
steeped also in the love of Science. His work was in his own image;
it was, like nearly all German Art, primarily ethic in its complexion;
like all German Art it bore traces of foreign influence—drawn, in his
case, first from Flanders and later from Italy. In his work, as in all
German Art, the national character asserted itself above every trammel
of external influence. Superbly inexhaustible as a designer, as a
draughtsman he was powerful, thorough, and minute to a marvel, but
never without a certain almost caligraphic mannerism of hand, wanting
in spontaneous simplicity—never broadly serene. In his colour
he was rich and vivid, not always unerring as to his harmonies, not
alluring in his execution—withal a giant.... In Holbein we have a
complete contrast to the great Franconian of whom I have just spoken;
a man not prone to theorise, not steeped in speculation, a dreamer of
no dreams; without passion, but full of joyous fancies, he looked out
with serene eyes upon the world around him; accepting Nature
without preoccupation or afterthought, but with a keen sense of all
her subtle beauties, loving her simply and for herself. As a draughtsman
he displayed a flow, a fullness of form, and an almost classic
restraint which are wanting in the work of Dürer, and are, indeed, not
found elsewhere in German Art. As a colourist, he had a keen sense
of the values of tone relations, a sense in which Dürer again was lacking;
not so Teutonic in every way as the Nuremberg master, he
formed a link between the Italian and the German races. A less
powerful personality than Dürer, he was a far superior painter. Proud
may that country be indeed that counts two names so great in art.”<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c020'><b>[758]</b></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>RUSKIN ON HOLBEIN</div>
<p class='c023'>It is quite true that he was a better painter than Dürer, for his
mastery of the technical side of his art was complete, while his artistic
temperament found expression in many different branches of the
decorative arts and crafts. He was thus much more than a great
painter: he was a great artist and a great craftsman as well, for though
he did not actually cut the wood blocks he designed, or fashion the
actual cups of gold and silver for which he made the working drawings,
he had so perfect a knowledge of the practical side of the crafts,
and of the artistic capabilities and the limitations of the mediums in
which his designs were to be carried out, that he was indeed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“notable workman” which Erasmus called him. In all that he did,
the greatness and the individuality of his style, his power of dramatic
composition, the versatility of his imagination and his restraint in the
use of it, his serene outlook upon life, and the perfect and unerring
unison of his eye and hand, combine with his insight into character
and technical skill of the rarest quality to make him one of the few
great masters of the world.</p>

<p class='c023'>Ruskin’s judgment of him, when comparing him with Sir Joshua
Reynolds, is so true and so just, that, although so well-known, a
sentence from it may be quoted here in conclusion. “The work of
Holbein,” he says, “is true and thorough, accomplished in the highest,
as the most literal sense, with a calm entireness of unaffected resolution
which sacrifices nothing, forgets nothing, and fears nothing.
Holbein is complete; what he sees, he sees with his whole soul; what
he paints, he paints with his whole might.”<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c020'><b>[759]</b></a></p>

<h3 id='app-A' class='c040'>(A) <span class='sc'>Early Drawing by Holbein in the Maximilians Museum, Augsburg.</span> (Vol. i. p. 43)</h3>
<p class='c041'><span class='sc'>The</span> drawing of “Calvary” in the Maximilians Museum, Augsburg
(Woltmann, 3), is probably the earliest one by Holbein of which we
have any knowledge. It is a silver-point drawing, touched with the
brush in brown, white being used for the high lights and red for the
representation of Christ’s wounds. It is a carefully wrought, youthful
piece of work, at the same time showing considerable feeling in its
rendering of the sacred subject. The Cross rises on the left, turned
away from the spectator, so that the body of Christ is seen almost
in profile against the sky. Mary and John stand below on the right,
the former with hands clasped in prayer and head bent in grief. Lower
down the rock, in the centre, kneels Mary Magdalen with uplifted
arms, and on the left of the Cross a man is standing with his back to
the spectator, wearing a tall hat of “beaver” pattern. In the background
beyond him is a second cross with one of the thieves, the
ladder still placed against it. Down below the heights there is a
glimpse of a mountain and buildings. This interesting early example
has been recently reproduced in the important publication of facsimiles
of the complete series of Holbein’s drawings, now in the course of
appearing under the editorship of Dr. Ganz—<i>Die Handzeichnungen
Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren</i>, viii. 1.</p>
<h3 id='app-B' class='c040'>(B) <span class='sc'>Designs for Painted Glass of the Lucerne Period.</span> (Vol. i. p. 79)</h3>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>EARLY GLASS DESIGNS</div>
<p class='c023'>The design for painted glass with the arms of Hans Fleckenstein,
of Lucerne, in the Ducal Gallery, Brunswick (not in Woltmann), is
the earliest in date of the series of designs for this purpose in which
Holbein made such fine decorative use of the landsknechte with their
picturesque costumes as supporters of the shield bearing the coat of
arms of the patron for whom the glass was ordered. In the Fleckenstein
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>design the warrior on the left is bearded, and wears a hat with
very large feathers, and a great sword, while a long lance is held aloft
in his right hand, his left resting on the top of the shield, towards
which he leans, and behind which his left leg is hidden. The man on
the right is younger and beardless. His head is turned over his
shoulder towards the right, and his flat black cap is worn jauntily over
one ear and covers one side of his face, while a large hat with a huge
mass of feathers is slung upon his back. His right hand rests on
his sword-hilt, and his left on the top of the shield. The background
is one of plain architecture, in striking contrast to the highly elaborated
ones to be seen in most of Holbein’s glass designs produced after his
visit to Italy. A barrel-roof is supported by flat columns with a round
arch, across which two iron bars run, as in the Solothurn Madonna
picture. On either side of this arch, on the top of the columns, stand
figures of St. Barbara and St. Sebastian. The shield contains in two
of the quarterings the Fleckenstein “house-sign” surmounted by a
bar, the other two being filled with lozenge-shaped divisions. On the
band at the bottom, left empty for an inscription, is written “hans
Fleckenstein, 1517,” and “J. Holbain,” the signature not being in
the artist’s own handwriting. It is reproduced by Dr. Ganz in <i>Die
Handzeichnungen Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren</i>, v. 4.</p>

<p class='c023'>The fact that the landscape backgrounds in several of Holbein’s
glass designs afford evidence of a journey across the Alps has been
touched upon in the text (see vol. i. p. 77), and further proof of this
is to be found in another design of this period, made, in all probability,
during a leisurely journey from Lucerne to Lombardy in 1518. This
is the striking design representing the Banner-bearer of the Urseren
Valley, in the Uri district—the valley watered by the Reuss, in which
Andermatt is the chief village. This drawing, which is in the Royal
Print Room, Berlin, is mentioned by Woltmann, ii. p. 120, as, in his
opinion, not by Holbein, but by some “good Swiss master.” The
landsknecht, a bearded man, stands full-face, with legs stretched wide
apart, and the banner held aloft in his right hand. His left rests on
his hip, and he carries a great sword. This animated, vigorously
drawn figure is evidently a portrait. The banner, an important part
of the design, bears on the left the figure of a bishop with crozier in the
act of benediction, and on the right a church, with the bull of Uri in
the sky above it, one hoof resting on the steeple. In the background
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>is represented the old pack-horse road over the St. Gotthard, up which
men are climbing with horses and mules loaded with barrels and bales.
On the summit rises the small church which is depicted on the banner.
The landscape is evidently one actually seen by the artist. The
setting is a very effective one, consisting of plain pillars and an arch,
the former with vine branches and bunches of grapes trained round
them in spirals, the leaves forming the capitals and bases, while other
branches stretch across the archway. Above the latter is a representation
of the Judgment of Paris, with the three nude goddesses
on the right, and Paris reclining on the ground on the left. Mercury,
holding the apple, and Venus, the outer figures of this group, are
placed upon the tops of the pillars on either side. The outlines
have been put in with a pen in brown, while the banner-bearer’s
face has been finished in water-colours, and the background slightly
washed with green. Reproduced in <i>Handzeichnungen Hans Holbeins
des Jüngeren</i>, iv. 4.</p>

<p class='c023'>The glass design containing the coat of arms of the Lachner family,
of Basel, in the Print Room of the National Museum, Stockholm (not
in Woltmann), is a year or two later in date, the elaborately imagined
architectural background indicating that it must have been made
shortly after Holbein’s return from Italy, when the recollections of
the Lombardic buildings he had studied with such keen interest were
still fresh in his memory. On one side stands a young, beardless
warrior as shield-bearer, his face in profile to the right, his lance over
his shoulder, and his right hand on his hip. Opposite to him is the
completely nude figure of a woman, her face turned towards the spectator,
and both hands resting on the shield. Her hair hangs down
her back in two great plaits, which are fastened together at the ends
with a long loop. This is a realistic study from the life, and one of
the very few drawings of the nude by Holbein which remain. The
coat of arms on the curved Italian shield consists of a pair of outstretched
wings, and these are repeated on the helmet which forms the
crest, from which masses of finely designed scroll-work fall on either
side. The two figures stand on a platform, below which are two crouching
fauns holding a tablet for an inscription. The background, as
already stated, is very elaborate, consisting of an open loggia with a
roof like the later “St. Elizabeth” glass design (see vol. i. p. 149
and Pl. 44), and friezes and a semicircular arch supported by pairs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>of columns with grotesque capitals, the arch being decorated with a
band of ox-heads and foliage. Other friezes are covered with carved
leaf and scroll-work, and above them are grotesque sculptured figures
and roundels with heads. Through the openings at the back only
the sky is indicated. This is a fine design, more particularly in
the figure of the man, and in the helmet with its scroll-work. It is a
washed drawing, with the knight’s face and hands and the body of
the woman put in with water-colour. Reproduced in <i>Handzeichnungen
Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren</i>, iv. 6.</p>
<h3 id='app-C' class='c040'>(C) <span class='sc'>Early Drawings for wall-paintings.</span> (Vol. i. p. 101)</h3>

<p class='c027'>In addition to the studies for wall-paintings made by Holbein
shortly after his return from Lucerne to Basel, described in vol. i.
pp. 98-101, there is another in the Ducal Gallery, Brunswick (Woltmann,
127), representing the Virgin Mary, as Queen of Heaven, with
the Infant Christ in her arms, which is signed and dated “1520, H. H.”
Her long hair falls in curls over her shoulders, and a plain circular
halo is placed behind her crown. She is looking down upon the Child,
whom she holds with both hands, and he is smiling back at her. She
is placed in a perfectly plain architectural niche, with two empty circles
for medallions on either side. According to an inscription on the
back, this drawing, which is in black chalk washed with grey, was,
towards the end of the sixteenth century, in the possession of Daniel
Lindtmeyer, the glass painter of Schaffhausen. Reproduced in <i>Handzeichnungen
Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren,</i> iv. 3.</p>
<h3 id='app-D' class='c040'>(D) <span class='sc'>Glass Designs with the Coats of Arms of the Von Andlau and Von Hewen Families.</span> (Vol. i. p. 145)</h3>

<p class='c027'>A third design for painted glass, representing the martyrdom of
the Holy Richardis, wife of the Emperor Carl the Big, is of about the
same date, and very probably belongs to the same series, as the two
designs bearing the coats of arms of the Von Andlau and Von Hewen
families, the second of which is dated 1520. St. Richardis, wrongfully
accused of unfaithfulness, proved her innocence by submitting herself
to the ordeal by fire. She was the patron saint of the convent
of Andlau in Alsace, which, according to the legend quoted by Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Paul Ganz, was erected upon ground which had been scraped up by a
bear. It is most probable, therefore, that Holbein’s design was commissioned
for the decoration of this particular religious house. The
drawing, which is in the Basel Gallery (Woltmann, 50), shows the
saint kneeling on the funeral pyre, her hands clasped in prayer, her
head bent, and her long curls falling below her waist. She wears a
large cross at her breast, and has a circular halo inscribed “<span class='fss'>S. RIGARDIS
VIRGO</span>.” On the right is a small kneeling figure of an abbess or nun,
with open prayer-book, and on the left the bear of the legend. Two
flying angels, with draperies very effectively arranged, hold the martyr’s
crown above her head. The ordeal takes place beneath a cupola,
with an opening in the centre, supported by pillars of fantastic design,
the bases of the nearer ones being decorated with medallions hanging
from chains. Below is the customary blank tablet for an inscription,
held by two grotesque sea-monsters with human heads. At the back,
seen through the open arcading of the building, there is a view of a
small walled town in a hilly country, with church and cloisters and
watch-towers, and, lower down, the red roofs of a cluster of houses.
This is one of the most charming of the numerous landscape backgrounds
which Holbein introduced into his glass designs and book
illustrations. The drawing is washed with grey, and the background
lightly touched in with water-colours. It is reproduced in <i>Handzeichnungen
Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren</i>, xi. 8.</p>

<p class='c027'>Miss Mary F. S. Hervey, in her <i>Holbein’s Ambassadors</i> (p. 22,
<i>note</i>), draws attention to some cartoons for tapestry representing
scenes from the Passion designed by Holbein. The reference occurs
in a letter from Carlos de la Traverse, written from St. Ildefonse
in Spain in 1779 to M. d’Angeviller, in which he proposes that the
latter should buy the cartoons. The offer, however, was declined
on the ground that Holbein was “un peintre sec et demi-gothique”
(See <i>Nouvelles Archives de l’Art Français</i>, 2nd series, vol. i. pp. 258-62).
It is possible that these designs were not for tapestry but for glass,
and they may even have been the set in Sir Thomas Lawrence’s collection,
now in the British Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE FAESCH MUSEUM</div>
<p class='c023'>Among the miscellaneous contents of the Faesch Museum, formed
by Dr. Remigius Faesch, or Fäsch, the most important are the few
works by and after Holbein. Most of these came to him by inheritance
from his grandfather, the earlier Remigius Faesch, burgomaster
of Basel, who married Rosa Irmi, the granddaughter of Jakob Meyer
zum Hasen, and so became possessed, not only of the double portrait
of Meyer and his wife, Dorothea Kannengiesser, painted in 1516, and
the two fine silver-point studies for the same, but also the famous Meyer
Madonna now at Darmstadt. This last picture, unfortunately for the
Basel Public Picture Collection, he sold to Lucas Iselin in 1606. Dr.
Faesch’s father, Johann Rudolf Faesch (1574-1660), also burgomaster
of Basel, became in turn the owner of the Meyer portraits and drawings,
and he added a number of other pictures to the collection. He was
acquainted with the painter Bartholomäus Sarburgh, who from 1620
to 1628 was busily occupied in painting portraits in Basel, and to
whom, in 1621, he gave a commission for a likeness of his son Remigius,
an excellent work now in the Basel Gallery. (Reproduced by Dr.
Emil Major in the sixtieth annual report of the Basel Picture Collection,
1908.) From Sarburgh, when that painter was in Holland, Johann
Rudolf Faesch obtained the copies of Holbein’s series of Prophets,
nine pairs (see vol. i. p. 88). The originals were in water-colour,
but were copied by Sarburgh in oil. He is said to have taken the
originals with him to the Netherlands, since which time all traces of
them have disappeared. These copies are in the depot of the Basel
Gallery; two of the pairs are reproduced by Dr. Ganz in <i>Holbein</i>,
p. 191.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE FAESCH MUSEUM</div>
<p class='c023'>Remigius Faesch the second (1595-1667) became a doctor of law
and a professor in the Basel University. He was an ardent collector
throughout his life, not only of pictures, but of books, medals, examples
of goldsmiths’ art, and antiquities. On the death of his father he became
the possessor of the Meyer portraits and the Sarburgh “Prophets.”
To these he added a small square portrait of Erasmus of the
Holbein school, and in 1630, Johannes Lüdin, a pupil of Sarburgh,
then in Belgium, copied for him the heads of Jakob Meyer’s son and
daughter from the Meyer Madonna picture; apparently not from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>the original, but from the copy now in the Dresden Gallery, which,
according to Dr. Major, was most probably the work of Sarburgh
(see vol. i. pp. 239-41). In 1648 Johann Sixt Ringlin copied for him
one of the versions of the double portrait of Erasmus and Froben (see
vol. i. pp. 166-8). Again, in 1667, the year of Faesch’s death, Lüdin
presented him with a small portrait of Holbein which he had painted
from Hollar’s etching dated 1641. Faesch also possessed a second
small portrait of Erasmus, copied from the roundel in the Basel Gallery,
several drawings of the Holbein school, and, among other things,
the original wood-block of the “Erasmus im Gehäuse.” On his death
Faesch left his collections and the mansion containing them in trust
as a Museum, with usufruct to his descendants for so long as there
should be a doctor of law among the members of his family, failing
which everything was to become the property of the Basel University.
The last of these doctors of law was Johann Rudolf Faesch, who died
in 1823, when the Museum and its contents were handed over to the
University, the pictures, drawings, and engravings eventually finding
a permanent home in the Basel Public Picture Collection.</p>

<p class='c023'>Dr. Remigius Faesch spent many years in the compilation of a
manuscript, in Latin, now in the University Library of Basel, which
he called “Humanæ Industriæ Monumenta.” One section of this
deals briefly with the life of Holbein and with his chief works then in
Basel in the Amerbach Cabinet and Faesch’s own possession, to which
reference has been made more than once in these pages. The original
text is given by Woltmann, ii. pp. 48-51, and extracts from it in <i>Das
Fäschische Museum und die Fäschischen Inventare</i>, by Dr. Emil Major,
which forms part of the Annual Report (1908) of the Basel Gallery,
already mentioned. It is from this exhaustive and highly interesting
account of the Faesch collections and the various inventories and lists,
printed in full, that the facts in this note have been taken.</p>

<p class='c023'>The reference to the double portrait of Erasmus and Froben in the
“<i>Humanæ Industriæ Monumenta</i>” is as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Erant 2 tabulæ junctæ, ligamentis ferreis ut aperiri et claudi
potuerint, in tabula dextra Effigies Johan. Frobenii Typographi, in
altera Erasmi sine dubio ab ipso Erasmo in gratiam et honorem
Frobenii, quem impense amabat, curatæ, et eidem ab Erasmo oblatæ, unde
et eidem dextram cessit: Ex his tabulis nobis exempla paravit pictor
non imperitus Joh. Sixtus Ringlinus Basil, An. 1648, quæ extant inter
effigies nostras.”</p>

<p class='c027'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Faesch’s account of the sale of the Meyer Madonna runs thus:—</p>
<div class='sidenote'>THE FAESCH MUSEUM</div>
<p class='c025'>“An. 163 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suprad. pictor Le Blond hic à vidua et hæredibus Lucæ

<p class='c027'>In this paragraph Faesch speaks of Johannes Lüdin as Ludi, but
in an earlier one, describing the portrait of Holbein after Hollar which
Lüdin sent him, apparently as a new year’s gift, he calls the painter
Joh. Lydio.</p>

<p class='c023'>In an inventory drawn up early in the nineteenth century by the
last keeper of the Museum, Johann Rudolf Faesch, the Sarburgh
“Prophets” are described as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“13 a 21. Ferners befinden sich in dem Faeschischen Museo noch

<h3 id='app-F' class='c040'>(F) <span class='sc'>Hans Holbein and Dr. Johann Fabri.</span> (Vol. i. p. 175)</h3>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN AND DR. J. FABRI</div>
<p class='c023'>It is very probable that Holbein’s absences from Basel in search
of work during his second sojourn in that city (1519-1526) were more
frequent than has been generally supposed. It is not to be expected
that many records of such journeys should remain, and for this reason
the recent discovery, by Dr. Hans Koegler, of such an absence during
1523 is of exceptional interest. His article, describing this discovery,
entitled “Hans Holbein d. J. und Dr. Johann Fabri,” was published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>by him in <i>Repertorium für Kunstwissenschaft</i>, vol. xxxv. pts. 4 and 5,
(1912), pp. 379-84. Fabri was Vicar-General of Constance, and afterwards
Bishop of Vienna, and a friend and correspondent of Erasmus.
During the autumn of 1523, at some place not yet identified, but evidently
in the neighbourhood of Constance, Holbein and Dr. Fabri
became acquainted, or renewed an earlier intercourse, for the Vicar-General
made use of him as the bearer of some letter, message of greeting,
or gift to Erasmus, and from the latter’s reply in acknowledgment
it is to be gathered that the relationships between the painter and the
author of <i>The Praise of Folly</i> were very friendly ones. The letter
from Erasmus to Fabri, written in November or December 1523,
begins:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Reverendo Domino, Joanni Fabro, Canonico et Vicario Constantien. domino
plurimum observando.—Salutem, vir amantissime, ex tua salutatione quam mihi
per Olpeium misisti, melius habui. Erat enim accurata, et veniebat ab amico, et
per hominem amicum. Spongiarum rursus tria milia sunt excusa, sic visum est
Frobenio...,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c027'>In this letter Fabri’s messenger is spoken of as “Olpeius,” and the
point for decision is whether this refers to Hans Holbein, or to a
second Olpeius occasionally mentioned in the correspondence of
Erasmus—one Severinus Olpeius, who acted as letter-carrier for
Erasmus more than once, and appears to have been in the employ of
the bookseller Koberger of Nuremberg. In one or two of the letters
of Erasmus the name “Olpeius” is undoubtedly intended for Holbein,
as in the one conveying his thanks to Sir Thomas More for the drawing
of the Family Group which More had sent to him by the hands of the
painter. In this letter, which is dated from Freiburg, September
1529 (see vol. i. p. 341), Erasmus says:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Utinam liceat adhuc semel in vita videre amicos mihi charissimos, quos in
pictura quam Olpeius exhibuit, utcunque conspexi summa cum animi mei voluptate.
Bene vale cum tibi charissimis omnibus.”</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN AND DR. J. FABRI</div>
<p class='c023'>Again, in a second letter from Erasmus to Bonifacius Amerbach
written from Freiburg on April 10, 1533 (wrongly dated 1535 in the
manuscript), first published by Dr. C. Chr. Bernoulli in 1902 (see
below, Appendix (<a href='#app-J'>J</a>)), the “Olpeius” of whom the sage speaks so
severely was almost certainly Holbein. Dr. Koegler brings forward
convincing arguments to prove that the artist was also the “Olpeius”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>of the letter to Dr. Fabri, and that the place of encounter was somewhere
in the Lake of Constance district. He also suggests that as
Dr. Fabri was connected in his official capacity with the Maria-Wallfahrts
Church in Rickenbach, for which Holbein’s earliest known
picture, the Virgin and Child of 1514, was painted, and as he was also
the personal friend of the orderer of that little work, Canon Johann von
Botzheim of Constance, he must have been already acquainted with
Holbein. In any case, it seems certain that, thanks to Dr. Kœgler,
we have here definite, though scanty, information of one more of the
painter’s wanderings in search of work.</p>

<p class='c027'>The charming device of boys throwing sticks at an apple tree,
which Holbein made for the publisher Reinhold Wolfe, seems to have
been familiar to most English schoolboys in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, as it was to be found in a Latin Grammar much in
use. There is an amusing reference to it in Henry Peacham’s <i>Compleat
Gentleman</i> (reprint of the 1634 edition, Clarendon Press, 1906,
pp. 126-7). He says:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Painting is a quality I love (I confesse) and admire in others,
because ever naturally from a child, I have beene addicted to the
practice hereof: yet when I was young I have beene cruelly beaten by
ill and ignorant Schoolemasters, when I have been taking, in white and
blacke, the countenance of some one or other (which I could doe at
thirteene and foureteene yeeres of age: beside the Mappe of any Towne
according to Geometricall proportion, as I did of <i>Cambridge</i>
when I was of <i>Trinity Colledge</i>, and a Junior Sophister), yet
could they never beate it out of me. I remember one Master I had (and
yet living not farre from <i>S. Albanes</i>) tooke me one time drawing
out with my penne that peare-tree and boyes throwing at it, at the end
of the Latine Grammar: which hee perceiving, in a rage strooke me with
the great end of the rodde, and rent my paper, swearing it was the
onely way to teach me to robbe Orchards; beside, that I was placed
with him to be made a Scholler and not a Painter, which I was very
likely to doe; when I well remember he construed me the beginning of
the first <i>Ode</i> in <i>Horace</i>, <i>Edite</i>, set ye forth,

</div>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>THE MORE FAMILY GROUP</div>
<p class='c023'>There is a very interesting manuscript book, dated 1859, in the
possession of Lord St. Oswald, which contains a descriptive catalogue
of the pictures at Nostell Priory, together with “Some brief Notices
of the sundry pictures of the Family of Sir Thomas More, Knt., Lord
High Chancellor of England, Temp. Henry VIII,” from which, through
the courtesy of the owner, the writer is enabled to give some extracts.
It was written by Lord St. Oswald’s grandfather, Mr. Charles Winn,
whose chief purpose seems to have been to controvert Horace Walpole’s
adverse criticism, based on George Vertue’s manuscript notes, of the
Nostell picture. Mr. Winn gives a short history and description of
the various versions of the Family Group. Speaking of the Nostel
Priory version, called throughout his notes the “Roper” picture,
he says:</p>

<p class='c025'>“This picture formerly belonged to William Roper, Esqre., son of
William Roper, Esqre., Prothonotary of the Court of King’s Bench,
temp. Henry VIII, who married Margaret, the oldest, and favourite
daughter of the celebrated Sir Thos. More, Knt., Lord High Chancellor
of England; and was painted for him by that renowned artist Hans
Holbein in the year 1530, as appears from the monogram and date on the
picture. It remained in this family till the death of Edwd. Roper, the
last in the direct male line of the Ropers of Well Hall, nr. Eltham,
Co. of Kent, and of St. Dunstans, nr. Canterbury; he had only one
child, a daughter, who married Charles Henshaw, Esqre., who on her
father’s death inherited all his property. The issue of this marriage
was three daughters, the eldest of whom married Sir Edward Dering,
Bart., of Surrenden Dering in the County of Kent; the second married
Col. Strickland of Beverly, in the East Riding of the Co. of York; and
the third, Susannah, married my great-grandfather, Sir Roland Winn,
Bart., of Nostel, in the West Riding of the Co. of York. Mrs.
Strickland died without leaving issue, and on the death of Mr.
Henshaw, his two surviving daughters succeeded to his real, as well as
personal property. The Holbein picture was valued at £3000, and Sir
Edward Dering preferring to have his share in money, my ancestor paid
him a moiety of the valuation, and thus became possessed of the
picture, which was conveyed to Nostel, where it still remains.”</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>THE MORE FAMILY GROUP</div>
<p class='c023'>Mr. Winn was of opinion that the version, with life-size figures,
painted in distemper, which belonged to Andries de Loo, was not the
picture at Nostell, the latter being painted in oil. He considered that
the De Loo version was the one formerly at Heron in Essex (afterwards
at Thorndon—see vol. i. p. 300), and that it was purchased at De Loo’s
death by Giles Heron, who married Sir Thomas More’s second daughter,</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Cecilia. Heron Hall was the seat of his family, and the property
passed into the possession of the Tyrrell family by the marriage of Sir
John Tyrrell with Margaret, daughter and heiress of Sir William Heron,
of Heron, Kt. Quoting Walpole’s statement that the Heron picture
“having been repainted, it is impossible to judge of its antiquity,”
he goes on to say that this “appears to me to go very far in proof of
the correctness of the opinion I have hazarded, as to who was the purchaser
of the De Loo picture, for it is hardly to be credited that had
this (Heron) picture been painted in oil colour it would have become
so injured as to require its being repainted to an extent to render it
<i>impossible to judge of its antiquity</i>.” Mr. Winn thought that Holbein
himself must have sold the distemper version to De Loo—though why
he should do so it is not easy to imagine, as it is natural to suppose
that Sir Thomas More or some member of his family would have
retained it—and that the East Hendred picture, in Mr. Winn’s time at
Barnborough Hall (see vol. i. p. 300), was the actual work painted by
Holbein for the Chancellor, either from the Basel sketch or the De Loo
example. It is not likely, he says, that Sir Thomas</p>

<p class='c043'>“would have allowed the picture in <i>Distemper</i> to be disposed of
to De Loo, ‘till he had secured a copy of it. I can hardly therefore
entertain a doubt that Sir Thomas <i>did</i> possess one of these
large Family pieces, and that the picture at Barnborough Hall is the
identical one. John More had this picture conveyed to Barnborough,
when he took up his abode there on the death of Mr. Cresacre, his
wife’s father.”</p>

<p class='c041'>The inference is that John More, as head of the family, inherited the
version of the Group expressly painted for his father. Mr. Winn says
of this picture that it is</p>

<p class='c043'>“in the <i>number</i> and <i>arrangement of the persons
represented</i> a <i>facsimile</i> of the <i>original sketch</i>, or
drawing, and I deem it far from improbable that it may be the picture
which was painted, by Holbein, for Sir Thomas; for although it is now
in a very deplorable state, caused by most unpardonable neglect, yet
there are parts which shew that the picture, in its original state,
was painted by no ‘prentice hand.’ It is now in a low room panelled
with oak, and has unfortunately been curtailed, both in width, and
depth, to fit it into the panel where it is placed, and this may
probably account for the absence of the monogram of the painter, and
the date. The present size of the picture is length, ten feet; height,
eight feet. The figures represented are the size of life.”</p>
<p class='c027'>Of the Burford picture (see vol. i. pp. 301-2 and Pl. 76) he says:</p>

<p class='c025'>“This picture was formerly in the possession of a branch of the More
family, who resided at Gobions, or Gubbins, not far from Barnet, in
Hertfordshire, for whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>I have no doubt it was painted, and probably by Zuccaro, as it bears
the date 1593—some of the figures are copied from one of the pictures
already alluded to (most likely from that at Barnborough); these are
Sir John More, Knt., Sir Thomas More, Knt., John More, Margaret Roper,
Cecilia Heron, Elizabeth Dancey, and Anne Cresacre. The other figures
(four in number, whose names I have given at page 12) are represented
in the costume of the period in which the picture was painted, viz.
temp. Eliz. How this picture came into the possession of the Lenthall
family is not certain, but the last possessor of it, of that name,
told a relative of mine that it had been purchased by their ancestor
the Speaker Lenthall, on the sale of Gobions and its contents.”</p>

<p class='c027'>After pointing out the differences between the Roper picture, the
other versions, and the Basel sketch, Mr. Winn concludes by saying:</p>

<p class='c025'>“There are other differences observable between the Sketch and the
Roper picture which though unimportant in themselves, yet when
considered in connection with those I have named, do I think afford
most satisfactory proof that the Roper picture is <i>no copy</i>, but
that it is, as Vertue asserts, an <i>original</i> production by
<i>Hans Holbein</i>.”</p>

<p class='c027'>It is not possible, however, to follow Mr. Winn in every one of his
conclusions, which would necessitate the belief that Holbein himself
painted no less than three versions of the Family Group—the one in
distemper, which was sold by the artist to De Loo, and afterwards
purchased by Giles Heron, now so injured that “it is impossible to
judge of its authenticity”; the one in oil painted for Sir Thomas,
which remained at Barnborough in the possession of John More and his
descendants, and has been cut down and subjected to “unpardonable
neglect”; and the Roper picture now at Nostell Priory. It seems
almost certain that Holbein had no hand in the painting of the two
first, and that they are merely early copies or adaptations from the
Nostell picture, though at the same time it should be pointed out
that they follow the Basel sketch more closely than the latter, and do
not show, as it does, various alterations in the design, such as the introduction
of the figure of the secretary Harris. This affords some support
to the contention that they are of earlier date, or copied from some
earlier version, than the Roper canvas. The Basel sketch would not
be available for the purpose, as it was taken with him by Holbein
when he left England in 1528. Still, in spite of this, the fact remains
that the Nostell Priory version is the only one that has any pretensions
to be regarded, even in a small part, as an original work by Holbein,
and until further proof is forthcoming it is safest to conclude that</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE MORE FAMILY GROUP</div>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Holbein, after making his preliminary studies, began a large canvas
which for some unknown reason was left by him in a very incomplete
state, and that Sir Thomas More had it finished by some other hand
in 1530, and that this picture was the one which came into De Loo’s
possession, and is now at Nostell Priory.</p>

<p class='c023'>One other point remains to be touched upon. Mr. Winn asserts
that in Vertue’s opinion the Roper picture is an original work by
Holbein, and he quotes in support of this statement from a manuscript
by Vertue in his possession which he bought at the Walpole
sale. He gives several extracts from it, among them the following,
upon which, apparently, he bases his contention:</p>

<p class='c025'>“But the original painting by Holbein of this family (More) has long
been preserved by the family of Roper at Eltham in Kent, and was till
of late years there to be seen, but of late at Greenwich in the King’s
House in the Park inhabited by Sir John Jennings, the family of Roper
having desired leave to place it there till their house at Eltham was
rebuilt.”</p>
<p class='c041'>There is, however, a second account of this picture by Vertue in his
diaries preserved in the British Museum (Add. MSS. 25071, f. 4), first
published by Mr. Lionel Cust in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, October
1912, pp. 43-4; and in this memorandum, in which the picture is
described in greater detail, there is no suggestion made that it is an
original work. Mr. Winn’s manuscript appears to be rather earlier
in date. In it Vertue speaks of his examination as having been made
at Greenwich (“I compared the first sketch and the large picture
together at Greenwich”—the “first sketch” he speaks of being
Caroline Patin’s engraving of the Basel drawing), but in the British
Museum memorandum he states that he examined it, at the request
of the Earl of Oxford, after it had been removed from Greenwich to
Sir Roland Winn’s house in Soho Square, when he “in a more particular
manner observd that the picture differs from the others, this
seeming to be the most compleated.” He goes on to say:</p>
<p class='c025'>“First that design at Basil, presented to Erasmus by Sr. Th. More, I
conceive to be the first sketch on lines on a sheet of paper, or
Holbein’s first draught, and in this large painting of the Family
containd the picture of Sir John Mores wife, a young Lady to whom he
was then lately married (and there is left out Margaret Giggs) as in
the design of the first, she only being a companion to his daughters
and a favorite of Mrs. More Sr. Thomas Lady. Then there is also
another person comeing in the room with srole in his hand—whose name
is ... Harisius ...
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>famulus, and behind a person setting reading on a desk—at bottom are
<i>two dogs</i> favorites, probably put in afterwards by another
hand.... There really does not appear to be that certainty of drawing,
strength of colouring, as in many other pictures of Holben. Therefore
in the oppinion of several judges &amp; professors of painting it is
doubtfull.”</p>

<p class='c027'>He goes on to say:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Upon another review of the Family peice of Sr. Thomas More—I observe
that the light &amp; shade of the persons represented are various, which
is not consistent to nature nor practice in the art of painting, for
as it is a view of this Family represented at once, the light ought to
proceed from one point throughout the whole picture, which it doth not
but some of the figures there represented, the light proceeds from the
right side and others from the left side. And the light on the face of
Sr. Thomas proceeds from the left and his father Sr. John is from the
right. And also the Lady of Sr. Tho. the light on her face proceeds
from the left so in several there is a disagrement of light and
shade.”</p>

<p class='c027'>Vertue’s explanation of the painting of the picture is that Holbein,
after taking various portraits of members of the More family, drew,
at Sir Thomas’s request, a design for a big Family Group, but that
before a start could be made on the picture by the artist Henry VIII
paid a visit to Chelsea, and was at once so captivated by the examples
of Holbein’s art which he saw there that he carried the painter off to
Court at once, and gave him so much to do that More’s commission
had to be abandoned. Sir Thomas, therefore, “after 1530” employed
someone else to paint the picture from the original design and
the finished family portraits, “perhaps, and not unlikely, some scholar
of Holbein’s with his knowledge and consent,” this pupil “so forwarding
it with as much skill as he was able ready for Holbein to go over
again and review and finish it.” This would be a matter of time, and
during the progress of the work several alterations and additions were
made, such as the introduction of the figure of Harris, which figure,
in Vertue’s opinion, showed “most visible difference in painting and
drawing,” so that it could not be copied from any painting by Holbein,
but was the original work of the assistant, who in this “ventured to
show all his skill with full liberty.” In conclusion he remarks that
“Raphael made many designs in small which were executed in large
by his scholars, some before his death and some after,” and suggests
that Holbein made the design for this Family Group with the same
intention—“Especially as it may be observd none of these faces,
hands coppyd from Holben’s painted pictures are not labouriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>finishd, but left broad and light, fitly disposed to receive any improvments
by Holbens hand—when, on the contrary, all the still life in the
picture, the jewells, ornaments, gold are highly finished.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE MORE FAMILY GROUP</div>
<p class='c023'>Since the Nostell Priory picture was photographed, thanks to the
kindness of Lord St. Oswald, for the purposes of this book, it has
undergone a thorough and very careful cleaning, with the result that
many details, previously almost obscured, can now be seen quite
clearly, while the general effect of the work as a whole has been greatly
enhanced. As noted in the text (see vol. i. pp. 295-6), the chief
points in which this picture differs from the Basel sketch is in the
change of position in the figures of Elizabeth Dancey and Margaret
Gigs, and the introduction of John Harris. Elizabeth Dancey, who
now stands next to Sir John More, is in exactly the same position and
dress as in the sketch, whereas Margaret Gigs, who now forms the
outer figure of the group on the left, is wearing a plain white head-dress,
as in the preliminary study at Windsor, in place of the angular
hood with black fall of the sketch; and she now stands upright,
instead of stooping, with her right hand resting on the book, indicating
a passage with her forefinger. The secretary, John Harris, on the
opposite side of the picture, has been brought from within the inner
room, in which he was indicated with another person in the sketch,
and now leans against one of the posts of the “porch” within the
larger chamber, having a roll with seals in his right hand; while his
companion is shown standing at the distant window, his back to the
spectator, reading a book he holds in both hands. The cleaning of
the picture has made clear the details of the furniture and various
objects placed about the room. The chief changes in these have been
already noted. The most important occurs in connection with the
large fitting or buffet on the left, which in the sketch appears as a
sideboard reaching to the ceiling, with panels of linen-work surmounted
by a carved canopy. In the picture this has been changed to a more
simple fitting or table, such as is shown in “The Two Ambassadors,”
covered with a Turkish cloth or carpet, the lower part of which forms
a cupboard, with a bottle and glass visible through one of the open
doors. Upon this, some of the plate, including the dish and the jug
with the cloth over it, have been retained, but pushed into the background,
with the two musical instruments placed in front of them,
while to the single vase with flowers another has been added. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of these holds lilies and carnations, and the other iris and columbines,
while the window-ledge on the extreme right, behind Lady More, has
now a large vase with flowers, instead of the jug, book, and flickering
candle. The clock is seen to be an astronomical one.</p>

<p class='c023'>In the foreground, where rushes are roughly indicated, the small
footstool and the scattered books have been removed, their place
being taken by the two feebly-painted dogs. Happily, during the
recent cleaning, the larger and more painful of these has been carefully
removed, to the very great advantage of the picture. Finally,
Lady More no longer kneels at a <i>prie-dieu</i>, but is seated, and the
chained monkey, instead of scrambling against her skirts, is placed
on its perch at her feet, looking at the spectator. The name and age
of each sitter is written over the head or across the dress, the one
over Margaret Gigs being in a different style of lettering from the
others. This last-named is merely “Uxor Johannes Clements,”
whereas in the East Hendred version, which seems to have been
based more directly on the original design than that at Nostell Priory,
it is “Margareta Giga Mori Filiabus condiscipula et cognata, A<b>o</b> 22.”
This has been taken to indicate that the East Hendred picture was
painted first, before the lady married John Clements.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>LORD ARUNDEL AND REMBRANDT</div>
<p class='c023'>A letter from Erasmus to Bonifacius Amerbach, preserved among
the Basel manuscripts, appears to have reference to Holbein’s second
journey to England, and at the same time to show that the relationships
between the philosopher and the painter were not, at that period at
least, entirely amicable ones. This letter, already referred to in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Appendix (<a href='#app-F'>F</a>), was first published by Dr. C. Chr. Bernoulli in the Basel
<i>Nachrichten</i>, No. 296, 1902, and is dated Freiburg, 10th April 1535,
but the year-date, it is stated, is wrong, and should be 1533. The
exact meaning of the letter is not quite clear, but in it Erasmus complains
somewhat bitterly of foolish behaviour and needless delay of
more than a month in Antwerp on the part of “Olpeius,” and of reprehensible
conduct on his part towards certain people in England to whom
Erasmus had given him letters of introduction. It seems almost certain
that in the “Olpeius” of this letter Holbein is intended. The
long stay in Antwerp of which Erasmus complains must have been
in 1532, and apparently it was not until the following spring that he
heard of it, after receiving letters of complaint about the painter from
one or more of his English correspondents. There is nothing in the
letter to indicate in what way Holbein deceived these unnamed friends
of Erasmus. The original text of the letter is as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Subornant te patronum, cui uni sciunt me nihil posse negare. Sic
Olpeius per te extorsit litteras in Angliam. At is resedit Antuerpiæ
supra mensem, diutius mansurus, si invenisset fatuos. In Anglia
decepit eos, quibus fuerat commendatus.”</p>

<p class='c027'>Several important pictures by Holbein appear to have been in
the Netherlands during the seventeenth century, and the Earl of
Arundel, through his friends and agents, made serious efforts to add
them to his collection, though in some instances the price asked was
too high for him. In this search for examples of Holbein’s art he
received considerable assistance from Sir Dudley Carleton, English
minister at the Hague, to whom the Earl wrote, on 17th September
1619: “I hear likewise, by many ways how careful your lordship is
to satisfy my foolish curiosity in inquiring for the pieces of Holbein.”
Two years later, as already noted (see vol. i. p. 241), Carleton was endeavouring
to obtain for him a picture by Holbein which may have
been the Meyer Madonna; and in 1628 another fruitless attempt
was made to purchase the portrait of Morette (see Vol. ii. p. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>-<a href='#Page_66'>66</a>).
Again, on 25th April 1629, the Earl wrote to Sir Henry Vane respecting
“a book of Holbein.” In the course of this letter he says:</p>

<p class='c025'>“I must likewise give you very many thanks for your care concerning Bloome’s
(Bloemaert’s) painting and book of Holbein, and the King protests against any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>meddling with it, at 600<i>l.</i>, which he says cost him but
200<i>l.</i> For the drawings I hoped to have had them for
30<i>l.</i>, but rather than fail, as I told you, I would go to
50<i>l.</i>, but never think of 100<i>l.</i>, nor 50<i>l.</i> offered
without sure to have it; if he would let it come, upon security to
send it back, I should be glad, if not, let it rest.”</p>
<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>SIR NICHOLAS POYNTZ</div>
<p class='c022'>What this book was it is now impossible to say, but it cannot have been
the one containing the Windsor drawings, which came to the Arundel
Collection from the Earl of Pembroke at about this time (see Sainsbury’s
<i>Original Unpublished Papers</i>, &amp;c., 1859, Nos. 44, 53, 55, and 57
in Appendix). It may have been the little book of twenty-two designs
of the Passion of Christ which Lord Arundel showed to Sandrart (see
Vol. ii. p. <a href='#Page_77'>77</a>).</p>
<p class='c023'>Another seventeenth-century collector of pictures, the great painter
Rembrandt, was an admirer of Holbein’s work, and at the end
of his life, when his fine collection had been sold and scattered
for the benefit of his creditors, and his monetary troubles were thick
upon him, we find him, nevertheless, offering the large sum of one
thousand gulden for some picture by the master. The document
referring to this offer, dated 15th October 1666, three years before
Rembrandt died, is quoted by Dr. Bode in his <i>Complete Works of
Rembrandt</i>, 1906, vol. viii. pp. 296-7. It is a letter written by Anna
de Witt, of Dordrecht, in the course of which she says: “Whereas
the picture is by one of the greatest painters of his time, Holbein, who
also painted the picture of their ancestor; for this Rembrandt offered
1000 gulden.” This ancestor was Willem Schijverts van Merode,
and the picture appears to have been a votive one, in which he was
represented as the kneeling donor. Dr. Bode, however, suggests
that in all probability the picture which Rembrandt was said to be so
anxious to possess was not by Holbein at all.</p>

<p class='c027'>Holbein’s original painting of Sir Nicholas Poyntz, from which

the Marquis de la Rosière, and photographed on that occasion by
Braun, but has since disappeared. Lord Harrowby’s picture, which

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>HOLBEIN IN WHITEHALL</div>
<p class='c023'>It was probably in Holbein’s painting-room in Whitehall that the
incident occurred which set going the story told by Van Mander—a
story for which, no doubt, there was some foundation in truth—of
Holbein’s violence towards a nobleman who insisted upon forcing his
way into the studio when the artist was engaged upon the portrait
of a lady, and who was, in consequence, thrown downstairs by the
infuriated painter. This story Walpole tells as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'>The writers of his life relate a story, which Vermander, his first
biographer, affirms came from Dr. Isely of Basil and from Amerbach....
The story is, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>one day as Holbein was privately drawing some lady’s picture for the
king, a great lord forced himself into the chamber. Holbein threw him
downstairs; the peer cried out; Holbein bolted himself in, escaped
over the top of the house, and running directly to the king, fell on
his knees, and besought his Majesty to pardon him, without declaring
the offence. The king promised to forgive him if he would tell the
truth; but soon began to repent, saying he should not easily overlook
such insults, and bade him wait in the apartment till he had learned
more of the matter. Immediately arrived the lord with his complaint,
but sinking the provocation. At first the monarch heard the story with
temper, but broke out, reproaching the nobleman with his want of
truth, and adding, ‘You have not to do with Holbein, but with me; I
tell you, of seven peasants I can make as many lords, but not one
Holbein—begone, and remember, that if ever you pretend to revenge
yourself, I shall look on any injury offered to the painter as done to
myself.’ Henry’s behaviour is certainly the most probable part of the
story.” (See Walpole, <i>Anecdotes</i>, &amp;c., ed. Wornum, vol. i. pp.
71-2.)</p>

<p class='c027'>Wornum gives a more elaborate account of the adventure (<i>Holbein</i>,
pp. 319-20), and it is also introduced by Richard Lovelace into his
poem called “Peinture: a Panegyrick to the Best Picture of Friendship,
Mr. Pet. Lilly” (Sir Peter Lely), included in <i>Lucasta</i>, first published
in 1649. The lines are as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When to our huffling Henry there complain’d</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Another seventeenth-century poet who makes reference to Holbein—in
this instance it is the Dance of Death which is in question—is
Matthew Prior, who, in his <i>Ode to the Memory of George Villiers</i>, says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>BARBER-SURGEONS’ PICTURE</div>
<p class='c023'>It has been suggested that Holbein’s painting-room at Whitehall
was over the so-called Holbein Gate. Numerous engravings of this
gate were made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and reproductions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>of several of these will be found in <i>Whitehall: Historical and
Architectural Notes</i> (Portfolio Monograph), by W. J. Loftie, F.S.A.,
1895, and in <i>The Old Royal Palace of Whitehall</i>, by Dr. Edgar Sheppard,
1901. Mr. Loftie reproduces an engraving of Whitehall showing the
Gate after a drawing by Hollar in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge;
the “Banqueting Hall, Holbein’s Gate, and Treasury,” from the engraving
by J. Silvestre, 1640; “Whitehall in 1724,” from the engraving
by J. Kip; “Holbein’s Gate,” from an engraving by G. Vertue,
1725; and “Whitehall, from King Street,” from an engraving by
R. Godfrey, 1775, after a drawing by T. Sandby, R.A. Dr. Sheppard
reproduces the engraving after Hollar, and the Kip and Vertue engravings,
and also “Whitehall,” from a picture by Canaletto in the
possession of the Duke of Buccleuch; and “A View of Whitehall with
the Holbein Gateway,” from a drawing by Paul Sandby in the possession
of Mr. E. Gardner.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
